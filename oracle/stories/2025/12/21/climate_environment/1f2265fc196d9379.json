  "description": "Old military air samples turned out to be a treasure trove of biological DNA, allowing scientists to track moss spores over 35 years. The results show mosses now release spores up to a month earlier than in the 1990s. Even more surprising, the timing depends more on last year\u2019s climate than current spring conditions. It\u2019s a striking example of how fast ecosystems are adjusting to a warming world.",
