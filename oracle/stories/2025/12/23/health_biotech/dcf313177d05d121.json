  "description": "A deadly hospital fungus that resists nearly every antifungal drug may have an unexpected weakness. Researchers discovered that Candida auris activates specific genes during infection to hunt for nutrients it needs to survive. This insight came from a new living-host model that allowed scientists to watch the fungus in action. The findings could eventually lead to new treatments or allow current drugs to be repurposed.",
