  "description": "Researchers studying people with major psychiatric disorders found that drinking up to four cups of coffee a day is associated with longer telomeres. This suggests a potential slowing of biological aging by about five years. However, drinking five or more cups showed no benefit and may even contribute to cellular damage. Coffee\u2019s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may help explain the effect.",
