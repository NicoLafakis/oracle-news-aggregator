  "description": "Kimchi may do far more than add flavor to meals\u2014it could help fine-tune the human immune system. A clinical study using advanced single-cell genetic analysis found that regular kimchi consumption strengthens immune defenses while preventing harmful overreactions. Researchers observed improved activity in key immune cells, with effects varying depending on fermentation methods.",
