  "description": "Scientists at Northern Arizona University are developing a promising new way to detect Alzheimer\u2019s disease earlier than ever before\u2014by tracking how the brain uses sugar. Using tiny particles in the blood called microvesicles, researchers may soon be able to gather brain-specific information without invasive procedures. If successful, this approach could transform Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis, monitoring, and even prevention, much like how doctors manage heart disease today.",
