  "description": "Scientists discovered that common food emulsifiers consumed by mother mice altered their offspring\u2019s gut microbiome from the very first weeks of life. These changes interfered with normal immune system training, leading to long-term inflammation. As adults, the offspring were more vulnerable to gut disorders and obesity. The findings suggest that food additives may have hidden, lasting effects beyond those who consume them directly.",
