  "description": "A new study suggests temporal lobe epilepsy may be linked to early aging of certain brain cells. When researchers removed these aging cells in mice, seizures dropped, memory improved, and some animals avoided epilepsy altogether. The treatment used drugs already known to science, raising the possibility of quicker translation to people. The results offer new hope for patients who do not respond to existing medications.",
