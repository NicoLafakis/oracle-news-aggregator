  "description": "When Earth was a molten inferno, water may have been locked safely underground rather than lost to space. Researchers discovered that bridgmanite deep in the mantle can store far more water at high temperatures than previously believed. During Earth\u2019s cooling, this hidden reservoir could have held water volumes comparable to today\u2019s oceans. Over time, that buried water helped drive geology and rebuild the planet\u2019s surface environment.",
