  "description": "A newly analyzed set of climate data points to a major volcanic eruption that may have played a key role in the Black Death\u2019s arrival. Cooling and crop failures across Europe pushed Italian states to bring in grain from the Black Sea. Those shipments may have carried plague-infected fleas. The study ties together tree rings, ice cores, and historical writings to reframe how the pandemic began.",
