  "description": "A large Mayo Clinic study shows that current guidelines fail to detect nearly 90% of people with familial hypercholesterolemia, a common inherited cause of dangerously high cholesterol. Many affected individuals already had early heart disease but never met testing criteria. Routine DNA screening could dramatically expand detection and prevention. The research underscores the need for genomics-driven healthcare.",
