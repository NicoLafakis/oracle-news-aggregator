  "description": "Scientists found that kale\u2019s prized nutrients are hard for the body to absorb unless they\u2019re eaten with oil. Cooking doesn\u2019t improve absorption, but adding oil-based dressings\u2014or even more advanced nanoemulsion sauces\u2014does. These combinations dramatically increase access to kale\u2019s carotenoids. The research could inspire new, healthier dressings designed to supercharge everyday vegetables.",
