  "description": "Researchers revealed that the microbial metabolite TMA can directly block the immune protein IRAK4, reducing inflammation and improving insulin sensitivity. The molecule counteracts damage caused by high-fat diets and even protects mice from sepsis. Since IRAK4 is a known drug target, this pathway could inspire new diabetes therapies. The study highlights how gut microbes and nutrition can work together to support metabolic health.",
