  "description": "Scientists exploring how the brain responds to stress discovered molecular changes that can influence behavior long after an experience ends. They also identified natural resilience systems that help protect certain individuals from harm. These findings are opening the door to treatments that focus on building strength, not just correcting problems. The work is also fueling a broader effort to keep science open, independent, and accessible.",
