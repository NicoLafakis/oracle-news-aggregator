  "description": "A decade-long study of older women found that tea drinkers had slightly stronger bones, while moderate coffee drinking caused no harm. Heavy coffee intake\u2014over five cups a day\u2014was linked to lower bone density, especially in women who consumed more alcohol. Tea\u2019s benefits may stem from catechins that support bone formation. The researchers say small daily habits could make a meaningful difference over time.",
