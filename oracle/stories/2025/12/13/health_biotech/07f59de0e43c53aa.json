  "description": "A new analysis suggests that people with type 2 diabetes who use GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Trulicity or Victoza may be less likely to develop epilepsy than those taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Semaglutide showed the strongest connection to lowered risk. Researchers caution that the findings show an association, not proof of cause and effect. More rigorous long-term studies are needed to understand the link.",
