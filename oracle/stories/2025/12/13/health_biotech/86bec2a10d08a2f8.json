  "description": "Researchers used AI to pinpoint a little-known monkeypox protein that provokes strong protective antibodies. When the team tested this protein as a vaccine ingredient in mice, it produced a potent immune response. The discovery could lead to simpler, more effective mpox vaccines and therapies. It may also help guide future efforts against smallpox.",
