  "description": "A new catalyst design could transform how acetaldehyde is made from renewable bioethanol. Researchers found that a carefully balanced mix of gold, manganese, and copper creates a powerful synergy that boosts efficiency while lowering operating temperatures. Their best catalyst achieved a 95% yield at just 225\u00b0C and stayed stable for hours. The discovery points to a cleaner, more sustainable path for producing key industrial chemicals.",
