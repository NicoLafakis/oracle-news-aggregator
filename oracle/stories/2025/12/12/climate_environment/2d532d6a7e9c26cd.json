  "description": "Fossils from Qatar have revealed a small, newly identified sea cow species that lived in the Arabian Gulf more than 20 million years ago. The site contains the densest known collection of fossil sea cow bones, showing that these animals once thrived in rich seagrass meadows. Their ecological role mirrors that of modern dugongs, which still reshape the Gulf\u2019s seafloor as they graze. The findings may help researchers understand how seagrass ecosystems respond to long-term environmental change.",
