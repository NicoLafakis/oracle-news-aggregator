  "description": "Researchers discovered that nerve injuries can alter the immune system throughout the body, and males and females react very differently. Male mice showed strong inflammatory responses, while females showed none, yet both transmitted pain-inducing signals through their blood. These findings reveal previously unknown pathways driving pain, especially in females. The work points toward new opportunities for personalized chronic pain therapies.",
