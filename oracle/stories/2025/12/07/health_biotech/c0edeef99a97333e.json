  "description": "Researchers have developed a new oral drug that boosts metabolic activity in muscle rather than altering appetite like GLP-1 drugs. Early trials suggest it improves blood sugar control and fat metabolism while preserving muscle mass, with fewer side effects. Because it acts through a different mechanism, it could be paired with GLP-1 treatments for even stronger results.",
