  "description": "Researchers successfully implanted a genetically modified pig liver into a human, proving that such an organ can function for an extended period. The graft supported essential liver processes before complications required its removal. Although the patient ultimately passed away, the experiment demonstrates both the potential and the complexity of xenotransplantation. Experts believe this could reshape the future of organ replacement.",
