  "description": "Researchers have found scientific support for the viral claim that rosemary can improve wound healing. Carnosic acid, a natural antioxidant in rosemary, promoted scar-free healing in mice by activating a nerve sensor tied to regenerative repair. Rosemary proved more potent and gentler than other herbs or compounds that target the same pathway. The work hints at a low-cost future option for reducing scarring in humans.",
