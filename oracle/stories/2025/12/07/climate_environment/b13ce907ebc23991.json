  "description": "A century-old North Atlantic cold patch is now linked to a long-term slowdown in the AMOC, the climate-regulating conveyor belt of ocean water. Only weakened-AMOC models match observed temperature and salinity patterns, overturning recent model trends. This slowdown affects weather systems, jet streams, and marine life throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The discovery sharpens climate forecasts and highlights a major shift already underway.",
