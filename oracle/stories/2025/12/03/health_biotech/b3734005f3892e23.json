  "description": "Researchers discovered that 168 common chemicals can disrupt the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, with some also promoting antibiotic resistance. Many of these substances\u2014found in food, water, and household items\u2014weren\u2019t previously suspected of affecting living organisms. A new machine learning model now predicts which chemicals may harm the microbiome. The findings suggest safety testing must expand to consider gut health.",
