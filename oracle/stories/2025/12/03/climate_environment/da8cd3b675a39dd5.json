  "description": "According to the latest data, electric vehicle dealers sold about 20 percent fewer used electric cars in October than in September and saw a 50 percent drop for new ones. The question now is whether this dip is a sign of a prolonged slump or a mere blip in an otherwise upward trajectory. \n<br><br>\nWhile only time will tell, many analysts believe that electric vehicle adoption in the United States will continue to grow \u2014 albeit maybe not at the same pace seen before Congress killed the credits and automakers started second-guessing themselves. \n<br><br>\nEliminating the federal credit of $7,500 on new EVs and $4,500 on used ones is certainly taking a toll. But the price of batteries, and thus cars, also continues to come down, and used models are becoming more of a bargain. Additionally, some states are trying to step in to fill the void the federal government has left.",
