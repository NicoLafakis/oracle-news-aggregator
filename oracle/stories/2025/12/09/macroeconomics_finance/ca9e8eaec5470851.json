The oil major raised $29 billion at the time. \u00a0\nSpaceX\u2019s management and advisers are pursuing a listing as soon as mid-to-late 2026, said some of the people, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential. The timing of the IPO could change based on market conditions and other factors, and one of the people said the timing could slip until 2027.\nA representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.
