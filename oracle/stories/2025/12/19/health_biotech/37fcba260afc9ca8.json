  "description": "Researchers have revealed that so-called \u201cjunk DNA\u201d contains powerful switches that help control brain cells linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. By experimentally testing nearly 1,000 DNA switches in human astrocytes, scientists identified around 150 that truly influence gene activity\u2014many tied to known Alzheimer\u2019s risk genes. The findings help explain why many disease-linked genetic changes sit outside genes themselves. The resulting dataset is now being used to train AI systems to predict gene control more accurately.",
