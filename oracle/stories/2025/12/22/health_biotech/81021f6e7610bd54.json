  "description": "Eating full-fat cheese and cream may be associated with a lower risk of dementia, according to a large study that tracked people for more than 25 years. Those who consumed higher amounts of these foods developed dementia less often than those who ate little or none. Interestingly, low-fat dairy products did not show the same pattern. Researchers caution that the findings show an association, not cause and effect.",
