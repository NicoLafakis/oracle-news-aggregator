  "description": "Scientists have discovered that complex life began evolving much earlier than traditional models suggested. Using an expanded molecular clock approach, the team showed that crucial cellular features emerged in ancient anoxic oceans long before oxygen became a major part of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Their results indicate that early complexity developed slowly over an unexpectedly long timescale.",
