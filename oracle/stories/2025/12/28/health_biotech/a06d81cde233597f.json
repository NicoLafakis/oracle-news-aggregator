  "description": "A major new review has put hundreds of alternative autism treatments under the microscope\u2014and most didn\u2019t hold up. Scientists analyzed decades of research and found little reliable evidence that popular approaches like probiotics, acupuncture, or music therapy truly work. Alarmingly, safety was often ignored, with many treatments never properly evaluated for side effects. The researchers stress that looking at the full body of evidence matters far more than trusting a single hopeful study.",
