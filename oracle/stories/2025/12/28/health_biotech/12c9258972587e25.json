  "description": "Weight loss restored healthy metabolism in both young and mid-aged mice, but the brain told a different story. In mid-aged animals, slimming down actually worsened inflammation in a brain region tied to appetite and energy balance. While this inflammation eventually subsided, brain inflammation has been linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease. The results suggest that weight loss in midlife may not be as straightforward as once thought.",
