  "description": "A new eco-friendly technology can capture and destroy PFAS, the dangerous \u201cforever chemicals\u201d found worldwide in water. The material works hundreds to thousands of times faster and more efficiently than current filters, even in river water, tap water, and wastewater. After trapping the chemicals, the system safely breaks them down and refreshes itself for reuse. It\u2019s a rare one-two punch against pollution: fast cleanup and sustainable destruction.",
