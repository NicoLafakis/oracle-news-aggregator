  "description": "Forskolin, a plant-derived compound, shows surprising potential against one of the most aggressive forms of leukemia. Researchers discovered that it not only stops cancer cells from growing but also makes them far more vulnerable to chemotherapy by preventing them from pumping out the drugs meant to kill them. Experts say this dual action could help create safer, more powerful AML treatments with fewer harsh side effects.",
