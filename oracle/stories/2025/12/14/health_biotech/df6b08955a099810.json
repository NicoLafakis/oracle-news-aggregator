Researchers at Mayo Clinic have now taken an inventive leap by using aptamers\u2014tiny, shape-shifting DNA molecules\u2014to selectively tag these elusive cells. The project began as an offbeat conversation between two graduate students and quickly evolved into a collaborative, cross-lab effort that uncovered aptamers capable of binding to unique surface proteins on senescent cells.",
