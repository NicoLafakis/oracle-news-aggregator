  "description": "Researchers found that people with anxiety disorders consistently show lower choline levels in key brain regions that regulate thinking and emotions. This biochemical difference may help explain why the brain reacts more intensely to stress in anxiety conditions. Scientists believe nutrition could play a role in restoring balance, though more research is needed. Many Americans already fall short of recommended choline intake, making diet a potential area of interest.",
