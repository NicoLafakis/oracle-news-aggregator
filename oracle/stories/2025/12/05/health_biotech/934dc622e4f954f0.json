  "description": "A large study found that people with impaired kidneys tend to have higher Alzheimer\u2019s biomarkers, yet they don\u2019t face a higher overall risk of dementia. For those who already have elevated biomarkers, kidney problems may speed up when symptoms appear. The findings show that kidney health can change how Alzheimer\u2019s blood tests are read. Doctors may need to consider both organs to get a clearer picture.",
