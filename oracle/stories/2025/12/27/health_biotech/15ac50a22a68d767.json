  "description": "Researchers have discovered how cells activate a last-resort DNA repair system when severe damage strikes. When genetic tangles overwhelm normal repair pathways, cells flip on a fast but error-prone emergency fix that helps them survive. Some cancer cells rely heavily on this backup system, even though it makes their DNA more unstable. Blocking this process could expose a powerful new way to target tumors.",
