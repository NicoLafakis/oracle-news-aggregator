  "description": "Stanford scientists have uncovered how mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can very rarely trigger heart inflammation in young men \u2014 and how that risk might be reduced. They found that the vaccines can spark a two-step immune reaction that floods the body with inflammatory signals, drawing aggressive immune cells into the heart and causing temporary injury.",
