While it is not used as our primary method of obtaining goods and services in today\u2019s modern society it is still alive and well in small ways through smaller groups of people, small towns, and in less developed areas of the world.\n\nFor those of us living in developed areas we rely on the supply chain to get us the goods we need, and in exchange for the currency we make while working we have access to everything we need.
