This growth is primarily attributed to enhanced performance in the Tengizchevroil (TCO), Permian Basin, and Gulf of Mexico developments.\n\nChevron traces its origins back to the famous Standard Oil Company, founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1870. In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the split of Standard Oil into 34 smaller companies due to violations of federal antitrust laws. Chevron was one of these successor companies and was originally known as Standard Oil of California ( [ExxonMobil](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/), current",
