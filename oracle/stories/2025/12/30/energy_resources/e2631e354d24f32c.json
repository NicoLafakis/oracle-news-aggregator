While some names, including Costco, have sued the administration for tariff refunds, more than 700 US businesses [filed for bankruptcy](https://marketrealist.com/which-coffee-chains-went-bankrupt-recently/) in 2025, the highest number since 2010 and a 14% increase from the previous year. Tight credit, high interest rates, persistent cost pressures, and growing import costs as a result of Trump's chaotic trade tariffs are a few of the reasons for this spike. In contrast to earlier patterns that were dominated by retail bankruptcies, this year's impacted industries were primarily industrial, such as manufacturing and transportation, while consumer-focused companies, such as fashion, suffered large losses as inflation forced them to prioritize necessities.\n\n![(Image Source: Getty Images| Photo by Chip Somodevilla)](https://dmjzpe3a34ghz.cloudfront.net/b9d0d5bd-85d1-4bb2-8ebd-934bdc1f6c87.jpg)(Image Source: Getty Images\\| Photo by Chip Somodevilla)\n\nNotably, the first half of the year saw 17 significant bankruptcies involving businesses with assets over $1 billion.
