JUST OFF OF EXIT 83 ON 95, IN NEWBURYPORT, YOU\u2019LL FIND THE SPRAWLING CAMPUS OF ROCHESTER ELECTRONICS HERE IN FIVE DIFFERENT BUILDINGS WITH NEARLY A HALF 1,000,000FT OF MANUFACTURING AND STORAGE SPACE. THE NAME OF THE GAME IS SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS. WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP, WHAT CAN THAT MEAN? WITH THAT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, MEANS WOULD BE EVERYTHING FROM A MICROPROCESSOR ALL THE WAY DOWN TO A TRANSISTOR. CHRIS GERRISH IS CO-PRESIDENT OF THIS FAMILY OWNED ELECTRONICS COMPANY, FROM TELECOM TO MEDICAL TO DEFENSE, AGRICULTURAL OR ENERGY. THOUSANDS OF INDUSTRIES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD RELY ON ROCHESTER TO BUILD COMPUTER CHIPS FOR THEIR SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL COMPANY NEEDS. THIS IS PROBABLY ABOUT A 35 YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY. AS CHRIS EXPLAINS, A COMPANY LIKE JOHN DEERE MAY HAVE ORIGINALLY BUILT A CHIP TO RUN A TRACTOR, BUT AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCED, JOHN DEERE MAY NO LONGER HAVE THE CAPACITY TO KEEP BUILDING THAT ORIGINAL CHIP. SO THAT\u2019S WHERE ROCHESTER STEPS IN TO REPRODUCE AND REPLENISH THE SUPPLY OF ORIGINAL SEMICONDUCTORS NEEDED FOR TRACTORS ALREADY ON THE MARKET. SO THEY NEEDED TO HAVE A RELIABLE, CONTINUING SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THOSE PRODUCTS THAT THEY CRITICALLY NEEDED FOR ALL SORTS OF TYPES OF APPLICATIONS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WORK DONE HERE. THE MBTA RECENTLY CALLED ON ROCHESTER TO REPLACE A CRITICAL SAFETY CONTROL BOARD COMPONENT NEEDED FOR ITS TRAINS.
