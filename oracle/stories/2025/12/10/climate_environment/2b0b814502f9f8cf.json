  "description": "New research reveals that Earth\u2019s solid inner core is actually in a superionic state, where carbon atoms flow freely through a solid iron lattice. This unusual behavior makes the core soft, matching seismic observations that have puzzled scientists for decades. The mobility of these light elements may also contribute energy to Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The findings reshape models of Earth\u2019s interior and could apply to other rocky planets.",
