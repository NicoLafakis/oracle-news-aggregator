  "description": "Researchers discovered that a long-misunderstood protein plays a key role in helping chromosomes latch onto the right \u201ctracks\u201d during cell division. Instead of acting like a motor, it works more like a stabilizer that sets everything up correctly from the start. This simple shift in understanding changes how scientists view one of the most important steps in biology. It also highlights a potential weak point that could help explain how some diseases begin.",
