  "description": "New research is challenging one of medicine\u2019s oldest assumptions: that cancer must be attacked to be cured. By treating glioblastoma patients with a simple combination of resveratrol and copper, the researchers found dramatic reductions in tumor aggressiveness, cancer biomarkers, immune checkpoints, and stem-cell\u2013related markers\u2014all without side effects. Their approach focuses on \u201chealing\u201d tumors by eliminating harmful cell-free chromatin particles released from dying cancer cells, which normally inflame and worsen the disease. The findings hint at a future where inexpensive nutraceuticals could transform cancer therapy.",
