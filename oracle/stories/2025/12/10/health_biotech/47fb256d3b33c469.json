  "description": "A Virginia Tech study shows that ultra-processed foods may influence adolescents differently from slightly older young adults. Participants aged 18 to 21 ate more at a buffet and snacked even when not hungry after two weeks on an ultra-processed diet. Because eating without hunger predicts future weight gain, these findings hint at a heightened vulnerability during late adolescence.",
