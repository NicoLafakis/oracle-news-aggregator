  "description": "Obesity accelerates the rise of Alzheimer\u2019s-related blood biomarkers far more rapidly than previously recognized. Long-term imaging and plasma data show that obese individuals experience much faster increases in proteins linked to neurodegeneration and amyloid buildup. Surprisingly, blood tests detected these changes earlier than PET scans. The results point to obesity as a major, modifiable contributor to Alzheimer\u2019s progression.",
