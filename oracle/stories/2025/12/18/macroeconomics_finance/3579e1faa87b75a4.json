Revenue rose 1% to $12.4 billion, above the average of analyst estimates.\u00a0The results show that while Nike is making clear progress, investors are clamoring more and want answers for other areas of the business that are lagging. The company has yet to issue longer-term guidance, indicating it\u2019s still getting a grip on operations as it looks to rebuild ties with retailers and sharpen its focus on key sports and cities.
