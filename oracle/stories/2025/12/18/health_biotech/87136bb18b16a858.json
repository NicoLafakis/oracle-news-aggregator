  "description": "Firefighter turnout gear is designed to shield first responders from extreme heat and danger, but new research suggests it may also introduce chemical exposures. A U.S. study found that brominated flame retardants are present across multiple layers of firefighter gear, including newer equipment marketed as PFAS-free. In some cases, these chemicals appeared at higher levels than the substances they were meant to replace.",
