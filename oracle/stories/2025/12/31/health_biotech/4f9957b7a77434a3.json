Data from an additional 19 evaluable patients enrolled in an expanded access program (EAP) also supported the regulatory decision.\n\nFindings from the TA-TMA Study indicated that [**narsoplimab**](https://www.onclive.com/view/narsoplimab-elicits-high-response-rate-improves-organ-function-in-hsct-tma) elicited a TMA complete response (CR) rate of 61% (95% CI, 40.6%-78.5%) in evaluable adult patients (n = 28); this rate was 68% in the evaluable EAP patients. When broken down further, the TMA response rate was 67% (95% CI, 22.3%-95.7%) in pediatric patients (n = 6) and 69% (95% CI, 38.6%-90.9%) in adult patients (n = 13) in the EAP.2\n\nAdditional data from the TA-TMA study showed that 61% and 75% of patients ex",
