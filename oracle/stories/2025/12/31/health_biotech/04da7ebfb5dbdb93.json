  "description": "New research suggests that even light alcohol use may carry serious risks. A large study in India found that drinking just one standard drink a day is linked to a roughly 50% higher risk of mouth cancer, with the greatest danger tied to locally brewed alcohol. When alcohol use overlaps with chewing tobacco, the effect becomes especially severe, potentially explaining nearly two-thirds of all cases nationwide.",
