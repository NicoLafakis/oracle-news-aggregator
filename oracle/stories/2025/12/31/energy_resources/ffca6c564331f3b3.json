  "content": "**An international team of astronomers from Chile, Europe, the United States, Canada and New Zealand has captured the most detailed spectroscopic glimpse yet of an interstellar comet traversing our Solar System. Using spectroscopic data from two instruments on ESO\u2019s Very Large Telescope (VLT), they\u2019ve detected atomic nickel and cyanogen gas emission from 3I/ATLAS, only the third confirmed interstellar object on record.**\n\n[![This image of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was captured with Hubble\u2019s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument on December 27, 2025.

Image credit: NASA / ESA / CSA / Hubble.\n\n3I/ATLAS was discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope on July 1, 2025.\n\nAlso known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and A11pl3Z, the interstellar visitor arrived from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.\n\nAt the time, the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 4.51 astronomical units (AU), with an eccentricity of 6.13.\n\n\u201cCharacterizing the volatile composition of interstellar objects passing through the Solar System provides a unique window onto the chemical and physical processes operating in distant stellar systems,\u201d said Dr. Rohan Rahatgaonkar from the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile and colleagues.\n\n\u201cInterstellar objects preserve signatures of the chemical and physical processes operating in their natal protoplanetary disks, potentially modified by exposure to the interstellar medium.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen heated by solar radiation, cometary interstellar objects release solids and gas due to cometary activity.\u201d\n\nIn July and August, the astronomers conducted a campaign of high-resolution spectroscopy as 3I/ATLAS re",
