To be blunt, Musk is a [\"bullshit artist.\"](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3551329-trump-elon-musk-another-bulls-artist/ \"(opens in a new window)\") He makes promises he can't keep. For example, everyone now is likely very familiar with his infamous 2011 interview with the [_Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-VCDB-10984?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqfOqP7NRwsIR6Pe-x7NdDhoIwHXCWiH0jqfL-OpxhgA8CX69xNvl2baIWsxAg%3D%3D&gaa_ts=69543d38&gaa_sig=3c0E85Y5sEG2MNfU3U6_3-nrIVLwNMv7R9qC1jiU8umWO74R5HaEOBFHZvIY2z9wzL8GBSOEljXpPVnq59EPQA%3D%3D \"(opens in a new window)\") where he said he'd put a man on Mars in 10 years. That was 14 years ago now and we're nowhere near putting anyone on Mars. Years ago, Musk also touted his proposed Hyperloop train system as a way to quickly transport people between cities; that never came to fruition and was [likely a ruse to stop other transit projects](https://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article264451076.html \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\nWith 2025 nearly over, Mashable decided to revisit his predictions related to this year. Time has run out. What did Musk promise for this year that didn't come to fruition?\n\n* * *\n\n**You May Also Like**\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n## People on Mars by 2025\n\nYes, I just mentioned that 2011 _Wall Street Journal_ interview where Musk promised to put a man on Mars in 10 years. However, this one is a completely separate promise from Musk regarding a man on Mars.\n\nBack in 2016 \u2014 roughly four years after his 10-year _WSJ_ claim \u2014 Musk made an appearance during [Recode's Code 2016 conference](https://www.theve",
