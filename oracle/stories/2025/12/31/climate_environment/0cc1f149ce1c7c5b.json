  "description": "Scientists have discovered a clever way to turn carrot processing leftovers into a nutritious and surprisingly appealing protein. By growing edible fungi on carrot side streams, researchers produced fungal mycelium that can replace traditional plant-based proteins in foods like vegan patties and sausages. When people sampled the foods, many preferred the versions made entirely with the fungal protein over those made with soy or chickpeas.",
