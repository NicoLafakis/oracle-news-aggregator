  "description": "SereNeuro Therapeutics revealed promising results for SN101, a first-in-class iPSC-derived therapy designed to treat chronic osteoarthritis pain while protecting joint tissue. Instead of blocking pain pathways, SN101 uses lab-grown nociceptors that act like sponges, soaking up inflammatory pain factors without sending pain signals. These cells also release regenerative molecules, offering disease-modifying potential that stands apart from traditional corticosteroids and single-target drugs like Nav1.8 inhibitors.",
