  "description": "Researchers discovered that tanning beds cause widespread, mutation-laden DNA damage across almost all skin, explaining the sharply increased melanoma risk. Single-cell genomic analysis revealed dangerous mutations even in sun-protected regions. Survivors\u2019 stories underscore how early tanning habits have lifelong consequences. The findings push for stricter policies and clear public warnings.",
