  "description": "Scientists have discovered that key compounds from cannabis\u2014CBD and THC\u2014show surprisingly strong effects against ovarian cancer cells. Used together, they slow cell growth, reduce colony formation, and may even block the cancer\u2019s ability to spread. Even more promising, the treatment caused minimal harm to healthy cells and appears to work by restoring a disrupted signaling pathway that fuels tumor growth.",
