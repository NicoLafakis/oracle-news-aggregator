  "description": "Researchers discovered a hidden molecular \u201cswitch\u201d that herpes viruses rely on to invade cells. By combining AI, simulations, and lab experiments, they identified and altered a single amino acid that shut down viral entry. What once might have taken years was achieved far faster using computational tools. The findings open new possibilities for designing future antiviral treatments.",
