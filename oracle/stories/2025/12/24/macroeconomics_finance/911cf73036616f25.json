  "description": "Woo Jin Ho, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Technology Analyst, joins Paul Sweeney and Kristine Aquino on Bloomberg Intelligence to discuss the 2026 outlook for the PC and computer hardware market, including Micron, Dell, HP, and more. AI is top of mind for these companies as server demand continues to accelerate. Dell in particular is expected to see a broadening customer base that will support a high-single-digit compound annual growth rate through fiscal 2030. Robust AI order activity and stable traditional server and storage trends will help sustain momentum. Elsewhere, Micron's 2026 DRAM-supply outlook offers little relief for HP and Dell's PC sales and margin. Micron expects DRAM-supply tightness at least through 2026 and into 2027, which forces personal-computer manufacturers to make tradeoffs between PC units and sales, especially at the higher end.
