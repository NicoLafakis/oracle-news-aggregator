  "description": "Researchers have created tiny metal-based particles that push cancer cells over the edge while leaving healthy cells mostly unharmed. The particles work by increasing internal stress in cancer cells until they trigger their own shutdown process. In lab tests, they killed cancer cells far more effectively than healthy ones. The technology is still early-stage, but it opens the door to more precise and gentler cancer treatments.",
