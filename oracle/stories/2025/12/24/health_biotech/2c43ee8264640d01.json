  "description": "Alzheimer\u2019s has long been considered irreversible, but new research challenges that assumption. Scientists discovered that severe drops in the brain\u2019s energy supply help drive the disease\u2014and restoring that balance can reverse damage, even in advanced cases. In mouse models, treatment repaired brain pathology, restored cognitive function, and normalized Alzheimer\u2019s biomarkers. The results offer fresh hope that recovery may be possible.",
