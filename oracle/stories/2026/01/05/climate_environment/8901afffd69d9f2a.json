  "description": "A meltwater lake that formed in the mid-1990s on Greenland\u2019s 79\u00b0N Glacier has been draining in sudden, dramatic bursts through cracks and vertical ice shafts. These events have accelerated in recent years, creating strange triangular fracture patterns and flooding the glacier\u2019s base with water in just hours. Some drainages even pushed the ice upward from below, like a blister forming under the glacier. Scientists now wonder whether the glacier can ever return to its previous seasonal rhythm.",
