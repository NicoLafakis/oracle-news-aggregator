  "description": "CES 2026, the annual consumer tech conference held in Las Vegas, is here. And lucky for you, we have TechCrunch editors and reporters on the ground to cover the news, scout out the interesting, weird, and relevant (and some not so relevant) tech, and of course the people working on it. Even before the official kickoff of CES on January 6, there will be product reveals from Amazon, Nvidia, Hyundai, AMD, and more. AI is at the center of most of the action. But this year, we're hearing a lot more about the convergence of AI and the physical world, whether it's in factories, robotics, or autonomous vehicles. Follow our live updates as we share all the reveals and new hardware as it happens.",
