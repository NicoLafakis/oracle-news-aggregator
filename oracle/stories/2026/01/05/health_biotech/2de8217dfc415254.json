  "description": "A large study has revealed that dozens of widely used chemicals can damage beneficial gut bacteria. Many of these substances, found in pesticides and everyday industrial products, were never thought to affect living organisms at all. When gut bacteria are stressed by these chemicals, some may also become resistant to antibiotics. The research raises new questions about how chemical exposure could be influencing human health behind the scenes.",
