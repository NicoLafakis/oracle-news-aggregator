  "description": "Researchers compared a traditional Chinese medicine, Yueju Pill, with a standard antidepressant and found both reduced depression symptoms. However, only Yueju Pill increased a brain-supporting protein associated with mood improvement. Brain imaging showed that unique network patterns\u2014especially in visual regions\u2014could predict who benefited most from Yueju Pill. This opens the door to more personalized depression treatments guided by brain scans.",
