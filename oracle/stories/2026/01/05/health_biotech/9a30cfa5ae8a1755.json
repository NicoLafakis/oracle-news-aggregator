  "description": "New research shows gut bacteria can directly influence how the brain develops and functions. When scientists transferred microbes from different primates into mice, the animals\u2019 brains began to resemble those of the original host species. Microbes from large-brained primates boosted brain energy and learning pathways, while others triggered very different patterns. The results suggest gut microbes may have played a hidden role in shaping the human brain\u2014and could influence mental health.",
