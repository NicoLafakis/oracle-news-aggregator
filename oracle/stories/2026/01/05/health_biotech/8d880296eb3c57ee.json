  "description": "Researchers have developed experimental compounds that make cells burn more calories by subtly tweaking how mitochondria produce energy. Older versions of these chemicals were once used for weight loss\u2014but were banned for being deadly. The new approach fine-tunes the effect, allowing cells to burn extra fuel safely. If successful, this could pave the way for new obesity treatments with added health benefits.",
