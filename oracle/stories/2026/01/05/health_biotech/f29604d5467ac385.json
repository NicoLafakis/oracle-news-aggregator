  "description": "A protein once thought to simply help cancer cells avoid death turns out to do much more. MCL1 actively drives cancer metabolism by controlling the powerful mTOR growth pathway, tying survival and energy use together. This insight explains why MCL1-targeting drugs can be effective\u2014but also why they sometimes damage the heart. Researchers have now identified a way to reduce that risk, potentially unlocking safer cancer therapies.",
