  "description": "People with spinal cord injuries often lose movement even though their brains still send the right signals. Researchers tested whether EEG brain scans could capture those signals and reroute them to spinal stimulators. The system can detect when a patient is trying to move, though finer control remains a challenge. Scientists hope future improvements could turn intention into action.",
