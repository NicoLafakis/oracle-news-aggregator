  "description": "Researchers discovered that clogged brain \u201cdrains\u201d show up early in people at risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These blockages, easily seen on standard MRI scans, are tied to toxic protein buildup linked to memory loss and cognitive decline. In some cases, they may signal Alzheimer\u2019s earlier than other commonly used brain markers. This could help physicians detect the disease earlier, before irreversible damage sets in.",
