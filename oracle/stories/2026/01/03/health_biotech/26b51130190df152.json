  "description": "Time-restricted eating has been widely promoted as a simple way to boost metabolic health, but new research paints a more complicated picture. When calorie intake stayed the same, an eight-hour eating window did not improve insulin sensitivity or cardiovascular markers. What did change was the body\u2019s internal clock, which shifted based on meal timing and altered sleep patterns. The results suggest calorie reduction, not the eating window itself, may be the real driver of health benefits.",
