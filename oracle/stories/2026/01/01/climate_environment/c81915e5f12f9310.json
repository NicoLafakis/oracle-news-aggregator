  "description": "A powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck northern Chile in July 2024\u2014and it wasn\u2019t supposed to be that strong. Unlike Chile\u2019s infamous shallow \u201cmegathrust\u201d quakes, this one ruptured deep inside the Earth, where shaking is usually weaker at the surface. Researchers discovered that the quake broke long-held assumptions by tearing through hotter rock layers than expected, fueled by a rare chain reaction that accelerated the rupture.",
