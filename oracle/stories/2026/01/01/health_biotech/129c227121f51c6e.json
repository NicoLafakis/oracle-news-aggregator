  "title": "A key Alzheimer\u2019s gene emerges in African American brain study",
  "description": "Scientists studying Alzheimer\u2019s in African Americans have uncovered a striking genetic clue that may cut across racial lines. In brain tissue from more than 200 donors, the gene ADAMTS2 was significantly more active in people with Alzheimer\u2019s than in those without it. Even more surprising, this same gene topped the list in an independent study of White individuals. The discovery hints at a common biological pathway behind Alzheimer\u2019s and opens the door to new treatment strategies.",
