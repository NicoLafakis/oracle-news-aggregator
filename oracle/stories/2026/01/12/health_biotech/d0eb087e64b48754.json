  "description": "Researchers have discovered a brain activity pattern that can predict which people with mild cognitive impairment are likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Using a noninvasive brain scanning technique and a custom analysis tool, they detected subtle changes in electrical signals tied to memory processing years before diagnosis. The findings point to a new way of spotting Alzheimer\u2019s early\u2014by listening directly to how neurons behave.",
