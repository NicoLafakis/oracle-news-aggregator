  "description": "Earthquakes happen daily, sometimes with devastating consequences, yet predicting them remains out of reach. What scientists can do is map the hidden layers beneath the surface that control how strongly the ground shakes. A new approach speeds up complex seismic simulations by a factor of about 1,000, making risk assessments far more practical. While it won\u2019t forecast the next quake, it could help cities better prepare for one.",
