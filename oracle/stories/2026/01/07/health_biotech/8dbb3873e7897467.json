  "description": "Global cancer cases have surged dramatically, doubling since 1990 and reaching 18.5 million new diagnoses in 2023. Deaths have also climbed to over 10 million a year, with the steepest increases hitting low- and middle-income countries. Without urgent action, researchers project more than 30 million new cases annually by 2050. Alarmingly, around four in ten cancer deaths are tied to preventable risks such as smoking, poor diet, and high blood sugar.",
