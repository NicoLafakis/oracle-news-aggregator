  "description": "Researchers have developed a magnetic nanomaterial that can kill bone cancer cells and support bone regeneration at the same time. The material heats up under a magnetic field to destroy tumors, while its bioactive coating helps it bond to bone and stimulate healing. Tests showed rapid formation of bone-like minerals, a key sign of successful integration. The breakthrough could lead to smarter, less invasive treatments for bone tumors.",
