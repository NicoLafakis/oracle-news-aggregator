  "description": "A familiar mouth bacterium best known for causing cavities may also be quietly influencing the brain. Scientists found that when this microbe settles in the gut, it produces compounds that can travel through the bloodstream and harm neurons involved in movement. In animal studies, this process triggered inflammation, motor problems, and brain changes linked to Parkinson\u2019s disease. The findings hint that protecting oral and gut health could help protect the brain as well.",
