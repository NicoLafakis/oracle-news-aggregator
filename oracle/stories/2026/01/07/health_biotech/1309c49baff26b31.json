  "description": "Researchers have reconstructed ancient herpesvirus genomes from Iron Age and medieval Europeans, revealing that HHV-6 has been infecting humans for at least 2,500 years. Some people inherited the virus directly in their DNA, passing it down across generations. The study shows that these viruses evolved alongside humans\u2014and that one strain eventually lost its ability to integrate into our chromosomes. It\u2019s the first time this long, intimate relationship has been proven with ancient genetic evidence.",
