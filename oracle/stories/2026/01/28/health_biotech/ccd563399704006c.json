  "description": "Scientists at KAIST have found a way to turn a tumor\u2019s own immune cells into powerful cancer fighters\u2014right inside the body. Tumors are packed with macrophages, immune cells that should attack cancer but are usually silenced by the tumor environment. By injecting a specially designed drug directly into tumors, researchers were able to \u201creprogram\u201d these dormant cells to recognize and destroy cancer.",
