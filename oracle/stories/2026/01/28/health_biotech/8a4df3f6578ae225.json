  "description": "Researchers have developed smart nanoparticles that can seek out and destroy disease-causing proteins the body can\u2019t normally eliminate. Unlike traditional drugs, these particles can reach hard-to-access tissues, including the brain, and precisely target problem proteins without widespread side effects. Early results show promise against major cancer drivers, and the platform is designed to be easily adapted to many diseases. The work could reshape the future of precision medicine.",
