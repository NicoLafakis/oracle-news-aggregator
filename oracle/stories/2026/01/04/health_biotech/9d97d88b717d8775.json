  "description": "Type 2 diabetes doesn\u2019t just raise the risk of heart disease\u2014it physically reshapes the heart itself. Researchers studying donated human hearts found that diabetes disrupts how heart cells produce energy, weakens the muscle\u2019s structure, and triggers a buildup of stiff, fibrous tissue that makes it harder for the heart to pump. These changes are especially severe in people with ischemic heart disease, the most common cause of heart failure.",
