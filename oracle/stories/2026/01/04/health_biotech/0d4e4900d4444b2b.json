  "description": "Researchers have discovered a way to help aging intestines heal themselves using CAR T-cell therapy. By targeting senescent cells that build up over time, the treatment boosted gut regeneration, reduced inflammation, and improved nutrient absorption in mice. It even helped protect the intestine from radiation damage, with benefits lasting up to a year. Early results in human intestinal cells suggest the approach could one day improve gut health in older adults and cancer patients.",
