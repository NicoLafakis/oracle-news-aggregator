  "description": "A new study reveals that super agers over 80 have a distinct genetic edge. They are much less likely to carry the gene most associated with Alzheimer\u2019s risk, even when compared with other healthy seniors. Researchers also found higher levels of a protective gene variant in this group. Together, the findings help explain why some people age with remarkably youthful minds.",
