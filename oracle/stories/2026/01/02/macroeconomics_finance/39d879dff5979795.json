  "description": "Bill Shufelt, cofounder and CEO of Athletic Brewing Company, was interviewed on January 2, 2026, discussing the rapid expansion of the nonalcoholic beer market. Shufelt highlighted that the U.S. market has grown from $100 million to over $1 billion in the past decade, with Athletic holding an 18.4% share and leading the craft segment. He attributed growth to shifting consumer preferences, especially among younger and health-conscious demographics, and noted that over 40% of consumers participate in Dry January. Shufelt outlined ongoing innovation, significant investment in manufacturing, and future plans for broader distribution, partnerships, and possibly going public. (Source: Bloomberg)",
