  "description": "Rare rocks buried deep in central Australia have revealed how a valuable niobium deposit formed during the breakup of an ancient supercontinent. More than 800 million years ago, tectonic rifting opened pathways that allowed metal-rich magma to rise from the mantle. These unusual rocks contain niobium, a key ingredient in high-strength steel, electric vehicles, and emerging energy technologies. The discovery offers fresh insight into how some of Earth\u2019s most important mineral resources reach the surface.",
