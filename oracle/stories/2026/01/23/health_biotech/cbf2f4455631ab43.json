  "description": "Alzheimer\u2019s may be driven far more by genetics than previously thought, with one gene playing an outsized role. Researchers found that up to nine in ten cases could be linked to the APOE gene \u2014 even including a common version once considered neutral. The discovery reshapes how scientists think about risk and prevention. It also highlights a major opportunity for new treatments aimed at a single biological pathway.",
