  "description": "Researchers have identified a promising new weapon against triple-negative breast cancer, one of the most aggressive forms of the disease. An experimental antibody targets a protein that fuels tumor growth and shuts down immune defenses, effectively turning the immune system back on. In early tests, the treatment slowed tumor growth, reduced lung metastases, and destroyed chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells.",
