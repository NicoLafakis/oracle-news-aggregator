  "description": "New research suggests that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia may come from a brain glitch that confuses inner thoughts for external voices. Normally, the brain predicts the sound of its own inner speech and tones down its response. But in people hearing voices, brain activity ramps up instead, as if the voice belongs to someone else. The discovery could help scientists develop early warning signs for psychosis.",
