  "description": "A new study suggests that micro-doses of THC could help counter many long-term side effects of HIV treatment without causing intoxication. In animal models, low-dose THC reduced inflammation, improved gut bacteria, boosted serotonin, and lowered harmful cholesterol and bile acids. Surprisingly, it also reduced circulating levels of antiretroviral drugs while maintaining viral suppression, potentially protecting the liver. Scientists say the results point to a promising new approach for managing chronic complications of HIV.",
