  "description": "New research suggests statins may protect adults with type 2 diabetes regardless of how low their predicted heart risk appears. In a large UK study, statin use was linked to fewer deaths and major cardiac events across all risk levels. Even those labeled \u201clow risk\u201d benefited, challenging long-held assumptions about who should receive preventive therapy. Side effects were rare and generally mild.",
