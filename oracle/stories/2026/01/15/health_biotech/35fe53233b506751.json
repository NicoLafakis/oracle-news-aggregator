  "description": "Spikes in blood sugar after eating may be more dangerous for the brain than previously thought. In a massive genetic study, people with higher post-meal blood sugar had a much greater risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The effect couldn\u2019t be explained by visible brain damage, suggesting hidden biological pathways may be involved. Researchers say managing blood sugar after meals could become a key strategy for reducing dementia risk.",
