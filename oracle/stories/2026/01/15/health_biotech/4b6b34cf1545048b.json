  "description": "Pancreatic cancer uses a sugar-coated disguise to evade the immune system, helping explain why it\u2019s so hard to treat. Northwestern scientists discovered this hidden mechanism and created an antibody that strips away the tumor\u2019s protective signal. In animal tests, immune cells sprang back into action and tumors grew much more slowly. The team is now refining the therapy for future human trials.",
