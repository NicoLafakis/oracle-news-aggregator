A McGill University study found that several BPA substitutes used in grocery price labels can seep into food and interfere with vital processes in human ovarian cells. Some triggered unusual fat buildup and disrupted genes linked to cell repair and growth. The results raise concerns that BPA replacements may be just as troubling as the chemical they replaced.",
