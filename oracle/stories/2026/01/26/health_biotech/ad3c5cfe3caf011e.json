  "description": "A 5,500-year-old skeleton from Colombia has revealed the oldest known genome of the bacterium linked to syphilis and related diseases. The ancient strain doesn\u2019t fit neatly into modern categories, hinting at a forgotten form that split off early in the pathogen\u2019s evolution. This pushes the history of treponemal diseases in the Americas back by millennia and shows they were already diversifying long before written records.",
