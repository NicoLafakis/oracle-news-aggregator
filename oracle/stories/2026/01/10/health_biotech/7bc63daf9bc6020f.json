  "description": "Pancreatic cancer is notoriously hard to treat, often resisting therapies that target its most common mutations. Researchers have now uncovered a hidden three-part loop that fuels tumor growth, involving the cancer drivers SRSF1, AURKA, and MYC. By targeting just one part of this loop with a specially designed molecule, they were able to shut down all three at once. The result was a dramatic loss of tumor cell survival, offering new hope for smarter, more effective treatments.",
