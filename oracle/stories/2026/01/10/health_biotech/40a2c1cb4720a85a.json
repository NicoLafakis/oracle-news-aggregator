In a clinical trial, arginine-treated dental plaque stayed less acidic, became structurally less harmful, and supported more beneficial bacteria. These changes made the biofilms less aggressive after sugar exposure. The results point to arginine as a promising, natural addition to cavity-prevention strategies.",
