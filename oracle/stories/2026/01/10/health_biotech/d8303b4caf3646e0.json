  "description": "Although the gut renews itself constantly, its stem cells accumulate age-related molecular changes that quietly alter how genes are switched on and off. Scientists found that this \u201cepigenetic drift\u201d follows a clear pattern and appears in both aging intestines and most colon cancers. Some regions age faster than others, forming a patchwork of weakened tissue more prone to degeneration. Encouragingly, researchers showed this drift can be slowed\u2014and partly reversed\u2014by restoring iron levels or key cellular signals.",
