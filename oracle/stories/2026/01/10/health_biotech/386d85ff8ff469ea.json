  "description": "New research shows that aging blood can accelerate Alzheimer\u2019s-like changes in the brain, while younger blood may offer protection. In mouse experiments, older blood worsened memory performance and increased toxic protein buildup linked to the disease. The study also uncovered widespread changes in brain proteins tied to communication and signaling. The findings point to the blood as a powerful influencer of brain health\u2014and a promising new therapeutic target.",
