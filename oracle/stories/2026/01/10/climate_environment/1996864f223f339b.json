The study suggests Earth\u2019s continents didn\u2019t begin growing until hundreds of millions of years after the planet itself formed. When scientists compared the rocks with Moon samples from the Apollo missions, they found a remarkable match. The results support the idea that a massive cosmic impact gave birth to the Moon.",
