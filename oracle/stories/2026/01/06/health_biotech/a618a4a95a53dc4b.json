  "description": "Scientists have found that combining silybin with carvedilol works far better against liver fibrosis than either drug alone. The duo targets the root drivers of liver scarring, sharply reducing collagen buildup and liver damage in experimental models. Importantly, both drugs are already approved and commonly prescribed. That makes this discovery especially promising for rapid clinical translation.",
