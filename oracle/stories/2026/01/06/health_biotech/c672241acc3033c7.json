  "description": "Researchers at USF Health have discovered a new way opioid receptors can work that may lead to safer pain medications. Their findings show that certain experimental compounds can amplify pain relief without intensifying dangerous side effects like suppressed breathing. This research offers a fresh blueprint for designing opioids that last longer, work better, and pose fewer risks. It also opens doors to safer treatments for other brain disorders.",
