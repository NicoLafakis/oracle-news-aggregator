  "description": "Scientists have uncovered a surprising viral shortcut that turns moving cells into delivery vehicles for infection. Instead of spreading one virus at a time, infected cells bundle viral material into large structures called Migrions and pass them directly to new cells. This collective delivery jump-starts viral replication and boosts disease severity. The finding reveals a migration-based route of viral spread that defies classic models of infection.",
