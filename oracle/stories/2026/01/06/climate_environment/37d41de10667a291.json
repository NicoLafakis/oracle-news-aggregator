  "description": "When a huge earthquake struck near Kamchatka, the SWOT satellite captured an unprecedented, high-resolution view of the resulting tsunami as it crossed the Pacific. The data revealed the waves were far more complex and scattered than scientists expected, overturning the idea that large tsunamis travel as a single, stable wave. Ocean sensors confirmed the quake\u2019s rupture was longer than earlier models suggested. Together, the findings could reshape how tsunamis are modeled and predicted.",
