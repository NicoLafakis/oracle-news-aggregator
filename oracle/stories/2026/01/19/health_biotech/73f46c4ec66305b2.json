  "description": "A major new scientific review brings reassuring news for expectant parents: using acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy does not increase a child\u2019s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability. Researchers analyzed 43 high-quality studies, including powerful sibling comparisons that help separate medication effects from genetics and family environment. Earlier warnings appear to have been driven by underlying maternal health factors such as fever or pain rather than the medication itself.",
