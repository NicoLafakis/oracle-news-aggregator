  "description": "Cannabis-based medicines have been widely promoted as a potential answer for people living with chronic nerve pain\u2014but a major new review finds the evidence just isn\u2019t there yet. After analyzing more than 20 clinical trials involving over 2,100 adults, researchers found no strong proof that cannabis products outperform placebos in relieving neuropathic pain. Even when small improvements were reported, especially with THC-CBD combinations, they weren\u2019t large enough to make a real difference in daily life.",
