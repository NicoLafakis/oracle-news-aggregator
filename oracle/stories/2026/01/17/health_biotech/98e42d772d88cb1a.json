  "description": "Thyme extract is packed with health-promoting compounds, but it is difficult to control and easy to waste. Researchers created a new technique that traps tiny amounts of the extract inside microscopic capsules, preventing evaporation and irritation. The method delivers consistent nanodoses and could eventually be used in medicines or food products. It may also work for many other natural extracts.",
