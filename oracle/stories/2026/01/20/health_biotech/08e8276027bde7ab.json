  "description": "Researchers have identified a key molecular interaction that accelerates Parkinson\u2019s disease by damaging the brain\u2019s energy systems. They designed a new treatment that intercepts this harmful process, protecting brain cells and restoring their function. In lab and animal models, the approach improved movement and cognitive performance while reducing inflammation. The findings point toward a new generation of Parkinson\u2019s therapies aimed at the root cause, not just the symptoms.",
