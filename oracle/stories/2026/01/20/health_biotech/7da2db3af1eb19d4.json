  "description": "Scientists have uncovered new clues about why diabetic foot infections can become so severe and difficult to treat. By analyzing the DNA of E. coli bacteria taken from infected wounds around the world, researchers found an unexpected level of diversity, with many strains carrying genes linked to antibiotic resistance and aggressive disease. Rather than a single dangerous strain, multiple types of E. coli appear able to thrive in diabetic foot ulcers, helping explain why infections can worsen quickly and sometimes lead to amputation.",
