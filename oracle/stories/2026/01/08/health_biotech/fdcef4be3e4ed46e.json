  "description": "Exercise doesn\u2019t just challenge the body; it challenges how the brain interprets effort. Scientists discovered that vibrating tendons before cycling allowed people to push harder without feeling like they were working more. Their muscles and hearts worked overtime, but their sense of strain stayed the same. This brain-body mismatch could one day help make exercise feel less intimidating, especially for people who struggle to stay active.",
