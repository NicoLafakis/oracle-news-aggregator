  "description": "A brief, intense workout may do more than boost fitness\u2014it could help fight cancer. Researchers found that just 10 minutes of hard exercise releases molecules into the bloodstream that switch on DNA repair and shut down cancer growth signals. When these molecules were applied to bowel cancer cells, hundreds of cancer-related genes changed activity. The discovery helps explain how exercise lowers cancer risk and hints at future therapies inspired by movement.",
