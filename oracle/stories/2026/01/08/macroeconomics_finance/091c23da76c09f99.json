  "description": "The status of TikTok's US deal is relatively little changed one year after a tedious saga began over whether the app should stay in the US, or go, for national security reasons. Just before the end of 2025, Bloomberg exclusively reported that TikTok said it signed agreements for a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors, according to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg. That deal is expected to close in two weeks despite falling short of what the law requires, which is a clean break from its Chinese owner ByteDance Ltd. The deal also largely recycles a prior national security proposal that fizzled out under former President Joe Biden. So, what comes next for the platform and its users (and their data), and what remains to be seen when it comes to national security concerns? Bloomberg News Technology Reporter Alexandra Levine joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. She speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)",
