  "description": "Long COVID affects an estimated 65 million people worldwide and can damage the brain, heart, blood vessels, and immune system long after infection. Researchers now link symptoms to lingering virus, inflammation, micro-clots, and disrupted energy metabolism. While structured rehab and pacing can improve quality of life, a growing list of experimental treatments\u2014from antivirals and metformin to microbiome therapies and biologics\u2014shows early promise. Clear answers, however, are still limited by small studies and the lack of large, definitive trials.",
