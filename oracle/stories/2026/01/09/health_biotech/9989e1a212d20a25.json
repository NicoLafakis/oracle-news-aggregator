  "description": "A large genetic study shows that many people carry DNA sequences that slowly expand as they get older. Common genetic variants can dramatically alter how fast this expansion happens, sometimes multiplying the pace by four. Researchers also identified specific DNA expansions linked to severe kidney and liver disease. The findings suggest that age-related DNA instability is far more common than previously realized.",
