  "description": "Researchers have developed a new class of antibodies that amplify the immune system\u2019s ability to fight cancer. By clustering immune receptors that normally receive weak signals from tumors, these four-pronged antibodies push T cells into full attack mode. In early studies, they outperformed conventional antibodies at activating cancer-killing immune cells. The work opens the door to more effective immunotherapy treatments.",
