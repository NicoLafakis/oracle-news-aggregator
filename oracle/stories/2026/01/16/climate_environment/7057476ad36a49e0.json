When frozen, it forms crystals with highly reactive surfaces that can drive unusual chemical reactions, even in extreme cold. These reactions could produce more reactive molecules that pave the way for life\u2019s basic ingredients. The findings suggest frozen worlds may be more chemically active than once thought.",
