  "description": "Delta Air Lines gave a profit forecast that fell short of Wall Street estimates, with the major US airline taking a more cautious view for 2026 after the aviation industry emerged from a volatile year. As the first major US airline to report earnings, investors look to Delta for signs on the strength of the industry. The carrier\u2019s relatively tepid forecast stands in contrast with CEO Ed Bastian\u2019s optimism at the start of 2025 before President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to reset global trade and other disruptions battered flying, forcing airlines into reverse. Savanthi Syth, Managing Director for Airlines and Advanced Air Mobility at Raymond James, joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. She speaks with Tim Stenovec and Christina Ruffini.
