  "description": "Scientists tracking Earth\u2019s water from space discovered that El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are synchronizing floods and droughts across continents. When these climate cycles intensify, far-apart regions can become unusually wet or dangerously dry at the same time. The study also found a global shift about a decade ago, with dry extremes becoming more common than wet ones. Together, the results show that water crises are part of a global pattern, not isolated events.",
