  "description": "Scientists at Tufts have found a way to turn common glucose into a rare sugar that tastes almost exactly like table sugar\u2014but with far fewer downsides. Using engineered bacteria as microscopic factories, the team can now produce tagatose efficiently and cheaply, achieving yields far higher than current methods. Tagatose delivers nearly the same sweetness as sugar with significantly fewer calories, minimal impact on blood sugar, and even potential benefits for oral and gut health.",
