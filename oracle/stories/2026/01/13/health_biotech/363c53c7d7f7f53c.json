  "description": "Childbirth depends not just on hormones, but on the uterus\u2019s ability to sense physical force. Scientists found that pressure and stretch sensors in uterine muscles and surrounding nerves work together to trigger coordinated contractions. When these sensors are disrupted, contractions weaken and delivery slows. The discovery helps explain stalled labor\u2014and could one day lead to better ways to manage childbirth.",
