  "description": "MIT engineers have developed a pill that can wirelessly report when it\u2019s been swallowed. Inside the capsule is a biodegradable antenna that sends a signal within minutes of ingestion, then safely dissolves. The system is designed to work with existing medications and could help doctors track adherence for high-risk patients. Researchers hope it will prevent missed doses that can lead to serious health consequences.",
