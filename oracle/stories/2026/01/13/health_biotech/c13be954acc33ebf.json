  "description": "Some antibiotics stop bacteria from growing without actually killing them, allowing infections to return later. Scientists at the University of Basel created a new test that tracks individual bacteria to see which drugs truly eliminate them. When tested on tuberculosis and other serious lung infections, the method revealed big differences in how bacteria tolerate treatment. The findings could lead to more precise therapies and better predictions of treatment success.",
