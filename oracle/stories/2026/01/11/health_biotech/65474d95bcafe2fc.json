  "description": "KAIST researchers have developed a way to reprogram immune cells already inside tumors into cancer-killing machines. A drug injected directly into the tumor is absorbed by macrophages, prompting them to recognize and attack cancer cells while activating nearby immune defenses. This eliminates the need for lab-based cell extraction and modification. In animal models, the strategy significantly slowed tumor growth and sparked strong anticancer immune responses.",
