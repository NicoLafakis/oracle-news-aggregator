Jan, University of Pennsylvania**\n\n**Harrisburg:** The United States is seemingly moving toward a potential strike on Iran.\n\nOn January 28, 2026, President [Donald Trump](https://www.siasat.com/tag/donald-trump/) sharply intensified his threats to the Islamic Republic, suggesting that if [Tehran](https://www.siasat.com/tag/tehran/) did not agree to a set of demands, he could mount an attack \u201cwith speed and violence.\u201d To underline the threat, the Pentagon moved aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln \u2013 along with destroyers, bombers and fighter jets \u2013 to positions within striking distance of the country.\n\n[![Add as a preferred source on Google](https://www.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/preferred_publisher.webp)](https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=siasat.com)\n\nForemost among the various demands the U.S. administration has put before Iran\u2019s leader is a permanent end to the country\u2019s uranium enrichment program. It has also called for limits to the development of ballistic missiles and a cutting off of Tehran\u2019s support for proxy groups in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.\n\nTrump apparently sees in this moment an opportunity to squeeze an Iran weakened by a poor economy and massive protests that swept through the country in early January.\n\nBut as a scholar of Middle Eastern security politics and proliferation, I have concerns. Any U.S. military action now could have widespread unintended consequences later. And that includes the potential for accelerated global nuclear proliferation \u2013 regardless of whether the Iranian government is able to survive its current moment of crisis.\n\n[![MS Admissions 2026-27](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20336%20280'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://mseducationacademy.in/new-admission/?ref=siasat.com)\n\n## Iran",
