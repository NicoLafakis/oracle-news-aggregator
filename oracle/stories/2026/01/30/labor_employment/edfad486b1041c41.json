Ron DeSantis\u2019 wishes, the Florida Board of Governors preliminarily voted Thursday to freeze public university H-1B visa hirings for a year, leaving hopeful international academics without that option.\n\nDuring a meeting at Florida State University, the overseers of the State University System started discussion on the matter, prompted by President Donald Trump and DeSantis.\n\nThe board\u2019s action Thursday was formally a notice of intent, meaning the policy isn\u2019t up for approval until the board\u2019s next meeting, on Feb. 23.\n\nThe board language would prohibit universities from using the H-1B program to hire \u201cnew employees\u201d until Jan. 5, 2027.\u00a0The change would not affect current H-1B holders, according to system Chancellor Ray Rodrigues. The visas allow foreigners in specialty occupations to temporarily work in the United States.\n\n\u201cAs you may know, the Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications. During this pause, if approved, the board office working with our universities will be studying the cost of the H-1B program as well as how the program is used by our universities,\u201d Rodrigues said.\n\nRodrigues said one concern is that employers use the visa to bring in employees at lower than market wages. The state will research salaries of university workers to determine how that may play in Florida.\n\nFaculty representative Kimberly Dunn, an accounting professor at Florida Atlantic University, took issue with the proposal.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a pediatric cancer surgeon or globally recognized researcher, these individuals directly contribute to Floridians health, safety, and economic success. In many cases, the H-1B visa is the only viable pathway for bringing this leve",
