How does it work? And, what can we expect to see in the future?\n\n**What is a Waymo driverless taxi?**\n\n![](https://content.assets.pressassociation.io/2026/01/29165938/b7226db7-bd9b-48a9-8ec4-581f340cec41.png)A Waymo driverless taxi is designed to make taxis safer and more convenient. (Waymo)\n\nWaymo is a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent firm, Alphabet, and is an American autonomous driving technology company, which was responsible for developing the first self-driving Google project car in 2009.\n\nA Waymo driverless taxi is an electric vehicle equipped with several on-board sensors that remove the need for human input from behind the steering wheel when in full operation. The taxis currently operate in various cities across the globe such as Tokyo, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.\n\nIts purpose is to make taxis safer, more convenient and technologically advanced. They can operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n**How does it work?**\n\n![](https://content.assets.pressassociation.io/2026/01/29165643/885fe5f1-9f44-4d7e-a02d-8aceb60cbc0b.jpeg)A Waymo driverless taxi uses several cameras, radars, lidars and ultrasonic sensors.
