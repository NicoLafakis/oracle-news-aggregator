Warren_\n\nSeattle's handling of the 2020 Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone during the so-called \"Summer of Love\" has cost the city over $30 million, following a King County jury's decision ordering it to pay more than $30.5 million to the family of 16-year-old Antonio Mays Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMays Jr., as has been chronicled here at RedState, was gunned down by \"security\" in the CHOP zone, a roughly seven-block area that police and emergency personnel were forced to abandon during the George Floyd race riots.\n\nThe jury found the city negligent in its emergency response, which delayed life-saving aid, after first responders refused to enter the zone. Mays and another boy, 14-year-old Robert West, were shot in a stolen vehicle and had to be transported to medics outside the anarchist-controlled area.\n\nMembers of the jury seem to have decided these factors contributed to the teen's death. Some experts argued that a more timely intervention might have saved his life.\n\nThe verdict, reached earlier Thursday after 12 days of deliberation, awarded roughly $4 million to Mays Jr.'s estate and [$26 million](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/seattle-chop-verdict-city-must-pay-29-million-to-family-of-slain-teen/) to his father, Antonio Mays Sr. Mays' lawyer celebrated while the decision was read, while the father was overcome with emotion.\n\nTwitter Embed\n\n[Visit this post on X](https://twitter.com/KatieDaviscourt/status/2017002946740036017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E201700294674",
