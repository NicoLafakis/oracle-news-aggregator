We test price, range, efficiency, space, tech and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) in local conditions.**\n\nThanks to its combination of space, efficiency, style and technology, the Tesla Model Y was\u00a0the [best-selling electric car in Australia](https://www.racv.com.au/royalauto/transport/cars/australian-new-car-sales-2025.html) in 2025, increasing sales by 4.6 per cent to 22,239 vehicles sold, making it the tenth best-selling vehicle overall.\n\nHowever, the Tesla isn't without competitors in the burgeoning family medium SUV segment. Closing fast is the [BYD Sealion 7](https://www.racv.com.au/car-match/search/byd/sealion-7), which has hit the ground running in Australia, selling over 13,410 in its first part year on sale. Other mid-size electric SUVs that have proven popular in Australia include the [Kia EV5](https://www.racv.com.au/car-match/search/kia/ev5) (4,787) and [Geely EX5](https://www.racv.com.au/car-match/search/geely/ex5) (3,944).\n\nFighting back, Tesla has recently addressed one of its biggest weaknesses, improving its new vehicle warranty which is now offered at 5-year/unlimited kilometres for private buyers, a distinct improvement over the 4-year/80,000km warranty that last year\u2019s cars received.\u00a0Tesla has also rolled out Full Self-Driving (Supervised)",
