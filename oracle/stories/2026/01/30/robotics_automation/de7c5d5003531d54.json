While conventional headlights typically provide a visibility range of 100 to 150 meters, Raytron's automotive thermal cameras are more than double that reach, extending detection to over 300 meters. By capturing high-contrast thermal signatures, the system identifies pedestrians, animals, and obstacles in total darkness far earlier than visible-light cameras. When integrated into a th",
