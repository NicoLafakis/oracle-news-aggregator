(TSLA) or artificial intelligence startup xAI, [according](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-spacex-said-consider-222218321.html) to Bloomberg sources familiar with the matter. These deliberations highlight Musk\u2019s efforts to integrate his ventures, leveraging synergies in space technology, AI computing, and energy systems amid preparations for a massive initial public offering.\n\nThe merger considerations stem from Musk\u2019s overarching ambitions for SpaceX, which include deploying orbital data centers capable of handling intensive AI computations. A tie-up with xAI could provide that company with access to such space-based processing power, assuming the technical challenges are overcome, enhancing xAI\u2019s capabilities in advanced machine learning models like those powering conversational AI systems. Meanwhile, aligning with Tesla would capitalize on the electric vehicle make",
