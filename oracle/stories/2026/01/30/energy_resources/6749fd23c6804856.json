Diplomatic efforts to end the nearly four-year war continue, but no compromise has been reached on key issues\u2014including control over parts of eastern Ukraine and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe\u2019s largest. Putin\u2019s demand that Ukraine cede 20% of Donetsk region\u2014still under Kyiv\u2019s control\u2014has stalled progress. Zelenskyy also confirmed Russia has halted prisoner exchanges, with the last occurring in October 2025, citing Moscow\u2019s lack of interest in humanitarian swaps. Regarding energy infrastructure, Zelenskyy pledged Ukraine would not strike Russian energy facilities if Moscow refrains from attacking Ukrainian ones\u2014though no formal ceasefire exists. Ukraine\u2019s energy grid has suffered severe damage from repeated Russian strikes, causing widespread blackouts and heating shortages amid extreme cold\u2014temperatures in Kyiv are expected to plummet to -26\u00b0C by Sunday. While former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Putin agreed to pause attacks on Kyiv for one week due to harsh weather, the Kremlin confirmed only that Trump personally requested a halt to strikes on Kyiv\u2019s energy infrastructure until February 1.\n\n* * *",
