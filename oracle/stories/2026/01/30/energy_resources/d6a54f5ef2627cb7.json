Writ large, that suggests some caution may be warranted.\n\n![A bar graph showing where 7 key market indicators sit relative to their minimum and maximum over the past 20 years.](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/RFHCD7QGXBBKVJ57FWQ427OUKI.png)\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and National Association of Realtors.
