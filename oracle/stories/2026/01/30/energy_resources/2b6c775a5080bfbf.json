A spokesperson for Holtec said crews are completing maintenance activities and returning systems and equipment to an operational-ready state.\n\nOfficials note there is no firm restart date, as the timeline is dependent on testing and inspections required by federal regulators and industry standards. Holtec had previously planned to reopen the plant by the end of last year, but the schedule has been adjusted.\n\nIf Palisades resumes operations, it will be the first nuclear power plant in the United States to reopen after a shutdown, marking a notable milestone in the nuclear energy sector.\n\n# Related podcasts\n\n![podcast episode artwork](https://img.sparemin.com/background-images/prd/background-images/f2/94/44/84/f29444848fa999ef94a8c15472048b5a_450_450.JPEG)\n\nplay\n\n[Fort Wayne's Morning NewsDan Bongino is BACK!](https://play.headliner.app/episode/31094538?utm_source=DiscoWidget&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=WI_ckt3dqswn000013jvb0ww2knh_DV_cko4spbf500020uovi0bu245e&utm_cont",
