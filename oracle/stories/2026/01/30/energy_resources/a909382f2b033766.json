With its current climate targets and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the State is failing to comply with international agreements. As a result, the State is acting unlawfully toward the residents of Bonaire.\n\nThe court also found that the State has not taken sufficient measures to protect the residents of Bonaire in the climate crisis. The court orders the State to draw up an adaptation plan and implement it no later than 2030. In addition, within 18 months the State must set new binding targets for the entire Dutch economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to make a fair contribution to the goal of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees.\n\n* * *\n\n![Mobilisation for Europe's Energy Independence in Brussels. \u00a9 Eric De Mildt / Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-international-stateless/2026/01/261e677c-gp0su83u7-1024x683.jpg)\n\n\u00a9 Eric De Mildt / Greenpeace\n\n![\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea](https://s.w.org/imag",
