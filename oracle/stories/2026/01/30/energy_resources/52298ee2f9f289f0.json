A White House official confirmed the measure kept sanctions on production of [Venezuelan crude](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-883280), adding it \"would help flow existing product\" and that there will soon be more announcements on easing of sanctions.\n\nThe move could unlock billions of dollars in new US investment into Venezuela's crippled energy sector, but it excludes firms from rivals like China and Russia, signaling an \"America First\" approach to the nation's reconstruction.\n\nThe easing of some sanctions marks a pronounced shift from the previous strategy of granting individual exemptions.\n\n![View of an illus",
