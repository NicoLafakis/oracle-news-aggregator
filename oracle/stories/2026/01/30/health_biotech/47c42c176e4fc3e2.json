  "description": "A new drug developed by Australian researchers has shown promising results in reducing sepsis in a Phase II clinical trial involving 180 patients. The carbohydrate-based treatment works by calming a dangerous immune reaction that can cause organ failure. With no specific anti-sepsis therapy currently available, the findings mark a major step forward. Researchers now aim to move into Phase III trials.",
