  "description": "A fast-aging fish is giving scientists a rare, accelerated look at how kidneys grow old\u2014and how a common drug may slow that process down. Researchers found that SGLT2 inhibitors, widely used to treat diabetes and heart disease, preserved kidney structure, blood vessels, and energy production as the fish aged, while also calming inflammation. The results help explain why these drugs protect kidneys and hearts so reliably in people, even beyond blood sugar control.",
