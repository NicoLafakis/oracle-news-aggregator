It can detect early dysfunction in these vessels \u2014 a quiet warning sign of future heart disease \u2014 long before symptoms appear. Unlike traditional risk estimates, it measures real changes happening in the body. The portable system could one day be used in routine checkups to catch heart risks earlier.",
