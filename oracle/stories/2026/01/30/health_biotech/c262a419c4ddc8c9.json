  "description": "People who naturally stay up late may be putting their hearts under added strain as they age. A large study tracking more than 300,000 adults found that middle-aged and older night owls had poorer overall heart health and a higher risk of heart attack and stroke than those who were active earlier in the day, with the effect especially pronounced in women. Much of this elevated risk appeared to stem from lifestyle factors common among evening types, including smoking and inadequate sleep.",
