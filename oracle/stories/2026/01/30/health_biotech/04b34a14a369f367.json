Their faces can be seen on large screens showing their body temperatures in real-time.\n\n## What is the Nipah virus?\n\nTwo cases of the zoonotic virus \u2013 one passed from animals to humans \u2013 have been detected in West Bengal, eastern India, since last month.\n\nThe virus was first identified in Malaysia in 1998, when an outbreak occurred among local pig farmers. The result was devastating, with up to 105 deaths and the culling of over a million pigs in a bid to stop the spread.\n\nThere have been other outbreaks of Nipah in India since then, including in 2001 and 2007 in West Bengal \u2013 where the latest cases are from \u2013 and in [2018, when 17 deaths were reported](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/rare-brain-damaging-virus-spreads-panic-in-india-as-death-toll-rises/HEDWFKJETGUPXJCSGWI7QULL4A/ \"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/rare-brain-damaging-virus-spread",
