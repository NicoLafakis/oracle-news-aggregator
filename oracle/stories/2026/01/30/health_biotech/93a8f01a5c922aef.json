State sovereignty died with ICE\u2019s victims in Minneapolis who were killed or abused!\n\nWatching these killings recorded on numerous cell phones at numerous angles, one must wonder where these agents were trained, if at all, and who were the trainers!? It seems they\u2019re instructed to bunch up on a single person, perhaps a mere bystander, then administer capital punishment whenever they fancy it. No probable cause, no danger to the agents. Five or six against one. No accountability. Such bravado!\n\nDespite eyewitnesses and phone recordings at several angles, the bosses of these ICE and Border Patrol killer-gangs, namely Kristi Noem and Trump, denounce the victims as domestic terrorists deserving death, praise the shooters as dutiful officers of the law and prevent local law enforcement investigations. So much for innocent until proven guilty for the executed person. So much for our unalienable rights of life,",
