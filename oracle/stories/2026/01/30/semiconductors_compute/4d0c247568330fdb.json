Despite the decline in U.S.-bound exports, the People\u2019s Republic still reported a [record-shattering global trade surplus of $1.19 trillion](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/business/china-trade-surplus-exports.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: The countries that accept this redirected flood of goods will destroy their domestic manufacturing sectors and reduce themselves to economic vassals of China.\n\nChina knows it.
