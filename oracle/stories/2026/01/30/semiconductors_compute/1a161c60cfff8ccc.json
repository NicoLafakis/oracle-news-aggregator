Many of the games were sold directly by mail-order, or through tiny single-proprietor stores, and no software trade organization was collecting comprehensive sales statistics. In 1980, the magazine _Softalk_ began running a list of the top-thirty best-selling Apple II programs based on retailer surveys. It did not (and could not) provide absolute sales figures, but, although _VisiCalc_ sat at the top, twenty-two of the titles were games. Most were CRPG, adventure, and arcade action games (including Automated Simulations\u2019 _Temple of Apshai_, Sierra\u2019s _Mystery House_, and a maze game called _Head On_). Microsoft _Flight Simulator_ and the chess game _Sargon II_ took second and fourth position, while the wargames _Computer Bismarck_ and _Computer Ambush_, from Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI), could be found in the twenties.

Some firms refused to release sales numbers, but the highest selling title among those who did, the (now utterly forgotten) action game _K-RAZY Shoot-Out_, had sold 35,000 copies to date. Adventure and CRPG games made a strong showing: Infocom claimed 32,000 sales for _Zork_, Automated Simulations 30,000 for _Temple of Apshai\u00b8_ Sierra 25,000 for _The Wizard and the Princess,_ Sir-Tech\u2019s _Wizardry_ came in at 24,000 and Richard Garriot\u2019s _Ultima_ at 20,000.
