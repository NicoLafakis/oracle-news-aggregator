As AI technology continues to grow, investors are looking for stocks that show promising potential. With Nvidia leading the charge, there are several alternative AI stocks that may experience significant growth by 2026.\n\n## Top AI Stocks to Watch by 2026\n\nWhile Nvidia is expected to perform excellently in 2026, diversifying your portfolio with alternative stocks is essential. Here are three strong contenders in the AI space beyond Nvidia:\n\n### 1\\. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)\n\n- **Current Price:** $339.55\n- **Market Cap:** $1.8 trillion\n- **Gross Margin:** 59.02%\n- **Dividend Yield:** 0.91%\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is the world\u2019s largest chip foundry. It manufactures components for major companies including Broadcom and AMD. The firm has reported that the AI chip market will see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 60% from 2024 to 2029. For 2026, TSMC anticipates nearly 30% growth year-over-year in AI revenue, making it an attractive investment option.\n\n### 2\\. Broadcom\n\n- **Current Price:** $331.07\n- **Market Cap:** $1.6 trillion\n- **Gross Margin:** 64.71%\n- **Dividend Yield:** 0.73%\n\nBroadcom is pivoting towards the AI sector by designing custom chips for AI hyperscalers. Its AI semiconductor revenue in Q4 was $6.5 billion, a 74% increase year-over-year. Expectations for Q1 predict a doubling of AI semiconductor revenues to $8.2 billion. As a major player in the chip business, Broadcom\u2019s initiatives make it a compelling alternative to Nvidia.\n\n### 3\\. Advanced Micro Devic",
