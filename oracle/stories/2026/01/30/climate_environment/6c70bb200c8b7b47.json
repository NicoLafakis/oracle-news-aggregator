  "description": "A former EU trade negotiator reflects on the winners and losers in the new EU-India deal. The big question is whether this agreement signifies a tectonic shift in world trade: the world\u2019s two biggest democracies, the second and fourth largest economies, asserting common values in the face of a rogue US and a hostile China? The\u00a0EU certainly likes to think so.",

But still very valuable.\n\nThe EU-India FTA negotiations just signed (after 20 years!) liberalise \u2014 fully or partly \u2014 99 percent of Indian exports to Europe and over 95 percent of EU exports to India.\n\nKey service sectors like financial, maritime and corporate transfers are also opened.\n\nWhile less ambitious than the EU\u2019s previous free trade agreements this remains an impressive achievement given India\u2019s highly-protective tariffs and its historical reluctance to open its market through bilateral agreements.\n\n## **The Importance of Being Earnest**\n\nSo what changed? A combination of things. First, Europe \u2014 still trying to figure out how to avoid a trade war with Donald Trump, and reeling from its [failure to clinch the FTA with Mercosur](https://euobserver.com/197349/meps-refer-mercosur-deal-to-eus-top-court-in-major-blow-to-von-der-leyens-trade-agenda/) badly needed a trade success \u2014 or face what EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described as self-inflicted geopolitical irrelevance.\n\nAs Oscar Wilde might have said, to lose one trade agreement is unfortunate. To lose two is careless.\n\nSo Europe went into the endgame negotiations ready to trim ambition.
