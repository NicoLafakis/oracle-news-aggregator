But now researchers have confirmed, to the greatest extent yet, that this is indeed what\u2019s actually happening on the ground. What\u2019s more, they found that even relatively small upticks in EV adoption can have a measurably positive impact on a community.\n\nWhereas previous work [has largely been based on modeling](https://grist.org/energy/how-much-would-us-air-quality-improve-if-it-shifted-to-evs/), a [study published this month](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-5196%2825%2900257-8) in the journal Lancet Planetary Health used satellites to measure actual emiss",
