  "description": "Lomborg has performed a valuable service in exposing the economic wreckage of Net Zero and the hollowness of green utopianism. But by clinging to the premise that climate change must ultimately be \u201csolved\u201d through policy-directed and publicly funded innovation, he gives credence to the very worldview he criticises. His halfway house reassures moderates, comforts elites,\u2026, World's most viewed site on climate change, global warming, extreme weather, IPCC, NOAA, NASA, Arctic sea ice, urban heat islands, environmentalism., World's most viewed site on climate change, global warming, extreme weather, IPCC, NOAA, NASA, Arctic sea ice, urban heat islands, environmentalism.",

With voters \u201cweary of soaring energy bills and annoyed by increasingly hysteric and patronising climate rhetoric\u201d, governments from the US to UK, Germany to Australia are waking up to the \u201csimple truth\u201d: \u201caggressive Net Zero mandates are delivering economic pain for unmeasurable and far-off climate gain\u201d. Lomborg senses \u201ca new pragmatism\u201d entering the climate debate.\n\nLomborg takes the example of United Kingdom, whose Net Zero law [enacted in 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-becomes-first-major-economy-to-pass-net-zero-emissions-law) committed it to zero emissions by 2050. \u201cHailed as bold leadership, its reality has been economic sabotage\u201d as the UK\u2019s industrial electricity prices surged at four times the increase in the US \u2014 leaving the UK with the highest power rates in the Western world.\n",
