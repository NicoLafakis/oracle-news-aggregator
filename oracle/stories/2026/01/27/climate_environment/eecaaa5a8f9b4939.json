Scientists now think their survival in sandstone came from unusual ancient seawater chemistry that created clay \u201ccements\u201d around their bodies after burial. This process captured delicate shapes that would normally vanish. The finding helps clarify how complex life emerged before the Cambrian Explosion.",
