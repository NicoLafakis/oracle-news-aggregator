  "description": "Researchers have discovered a biological switch that explains why movement keeps bones strong. The protein senses physical activity and pushes bone marrow stem cells to build bone instead of storing fat, slowing age-related bone loss. By targeting this \u201cexercise sensor,\u201d scientists believe they could create drugs that mimic exercise at the molecular level. The approach could protect fragile bones in people who are unable to stay active.",
