  "description": "A long-term study found that while a ketogenic diet prevented weight gain, it also triggered major metabolic problems. Mice developed fatty liver disease, abnormal blood fats, and an impaired ability to control blood sugar\u2014especially after reintroducing carbohydrates. Male mice were hit hardest, showing severe liver damage. The results suggest keto\u2019s benefits may come with hidden risks over time.",
