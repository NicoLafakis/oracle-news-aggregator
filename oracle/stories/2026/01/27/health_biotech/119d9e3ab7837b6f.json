  "description": "A new genetic study suggests that obesity and high blood pressure may play a direct role in causing dementia, not just increasing the risk. By analyzing data from large populations in Denmark and the U.K., researchers found strong evidence that higher body weight can damage brain health over time, especially when it leads to elevated blood pressure. Much of the dementia risk appeared to be tied to vascular damage in the brain, which affects blood flow and cognitive function.",
