  "description": "A large French study tracking more than 100,000 people over a decade has found that higher consumption of certain food preservatives\u2014commonly found in processed foods and drinks\u2014is linked to a modestly higher cancer risk. While many preservatives showed no association, several widely used ones, including potassium sorbate, sulfites, sodium nitrite, and potassium nitrate, were tied to increased risks of overall cancer and specific types such as breast and prostate cancer.",
