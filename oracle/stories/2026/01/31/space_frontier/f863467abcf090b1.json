In a recent weekly briefing, T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Defense Ministry said its Somali-Turkish task force and air component command continue to support Somalia\u2019s counterterrorism capacity through \u201cmilitary aid, training and consultancy.\u201d\n\nThe reported move comes as tensions have risen across the Horn of Africa after Israel\u2019s decision in late December 2025 to recognize Somaliland \u2014 a move Ankara has condemned as illegal and destabilizing.\n\nSomaliland declared independence in 1991 but has long lacked international recognition, while Ethiopia\u2019s 2024 memorandum with Somaliland over sea access triggered a dispute with Somalia that T\u00fcrkiye later helped steer into talks under the \u201cAnkara Declaration.\u201d\n\nAnkara has also expanded its economic footprint in Somalia, including agreements in the energy sector \u2014 with T\u00fcrkiye planning to begin offshore drilling in 2026 \u2014 and cooperation in space",
