Middle East](https://www.theweek.in/specials/middle-east.html)_**\n\nRecent high-resolution satellite imagery captured by Planet Labs PBC has revealed significant activity at Iran\u2019s primary nuclear facilities at Natanz and Isfahan, both of which were targeted during the \u201c12-day war\u201d in June involving Israeli and American airstrikes.
