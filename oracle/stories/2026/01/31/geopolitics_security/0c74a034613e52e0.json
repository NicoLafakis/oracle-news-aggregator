However, officials fear the programme was not destroyed and that [the regime has been reconstituting](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/donald-trump-keir-starmer-iran-middle-east-beijing-b2909961.html) it. Iran denies trying to make a bomb, but says it is open to talks.\n\nThe decision to move a carrier strike group to the region gives Trump a wider range of options than he had earlier this month, when he vowed to come to the rescue of anti-government protesters being brutally killed and targeted by the regime.\n\nBut U.S. bases and partners in the region will be fearing an Iranian retaliation after regime officials threatened an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 response if provoked. _The Independent_ looks at what is likely to happen next in Iran.\n\n![A US fighter jet is prepared on the deck of an aircraft carrier en route to the Middle East](https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/28/15/20-e687430",
