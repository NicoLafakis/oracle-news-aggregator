Tesla also reiterated that production plans for the Cybercab remain on track for this year, a key reassurance for investors after repeated delays to earlier robotaxi targets.\n\nTesla shares rose about 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, before paring gains to trade up around 1.8 percent after executives outlined sharply higher capital spending plans.\n\nChief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said Musk's plans, which include Cybercabs, humanoid robots, Semi trucks, and Roadster sports cars, would push Tesla's capital expenditures above $20 billion this year, more than double the $8.5 billion spent in 2025.\n\nTesla is \"entering a transition phase\" in which investors are being asked to underwrite future revenue from self-driving software and robotaxi services before vehicle sales rebound, said Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com.\n\n\"(That) makes rollout metrics, not deliveries, the most important leading indicator from here,\" Monteiro said.\n\nMusk, who has previously made inaccurate forecasts about robotaxi rollouts, said ",
