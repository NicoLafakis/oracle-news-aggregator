The unusual charging experience of a Tesla Cybercab prototype has stirred fresh debate within the EV and autonomous-vehicle communities, with a recent sighting of the vehicle's charging port\u2014complete with a manual door and latch\u2014raising questions about how Tesla might bridge its highly anticipated wireless charging vision with practical needs today.\n\nFirst unveiled as a fully autonomous ride-hailing vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals, the Cybercab is meant to epitomise the future of robotaxis. However, the latest charging [footage](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybercab-spotted-interesting-charging-solution-stimulating-discussion/) has revealed a more grounded approach to keeping these vehicles powered, at least during the early stages of deployment.\n\n> \ud83d\udea8 Tesla Cybercab charging port is in the rear of the vehicle!\n>\n> Here\u2019s a great look at plugging it in!!\n>\n> [pic.twitter.com/SjbONjx5Iu](https://t.co/SjbONjx5Iu)\n>\n> \u2014 TESLARATI (@Teslarati) [January 29, 2026](https://twitter.com/Teslarati/status/2017022733247266897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n## Prototype Sighting Fuels Discussion\n\nIn footage shared online earlier this week, observers noted the Cybercab's charging port is located at the rear of the vehicle, complete with a traditional manual door and latch. An employee is seen connecting the prototype to a Tesla Supercharger, prompting fresh speculation about the charging strategy Tesla may adopt as the vehicle moves towards production. The sighting has become a talking point because it contrasts with Tesla's previously toute",
