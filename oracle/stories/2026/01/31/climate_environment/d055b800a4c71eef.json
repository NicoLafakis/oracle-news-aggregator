Unsplash+\n\nThe rapid rise of A.I. is reshaping global infrastructure demands, pushing data centers from around the world to scale at unprecedented speed to support increasingly compute-intensive workloads. What was once a steady expansion has become a sprint, driven by generative A.I., large language models and real-time inference applications that strain existing power, cooling and connectivity systems.\n\nSign Up\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

In the U.S., an [OpenAI-Oracle-SoftBank Stargate project](https://openai.com/index/stargate-advances-with-partnership-with-oracle/) has outlined five new data centers, totaling roughly five gigawatts of capacity, as part of a multi-year, multibillion-dollar expansion to support next-generation A.I. models. And in India, [Google](https://observer.com/company/google/ \"Google\") is investing roughly $6 billion to develop an [infrastructure hub in Visakhapatnam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-invest-6-billion-southern-india-data-centre-sources-say-2025-07-30/). But while data centers may appear to be proliferating everywhere, not all locations are equally suited to the demands of A.I.\n\nA.I. workloads have highly specific requirements, and where infrastructure is built has a direct impact on tim",
