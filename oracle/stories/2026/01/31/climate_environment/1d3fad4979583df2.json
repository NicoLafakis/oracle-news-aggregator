A recent [study](https://thejobsfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cliff-Edge.pdf?ref=ed_direct) cited by the GMB union paints a stark picture: the North Sea\u2019s offshore workforce, roughly 115,000 strong today, could be slashed to around 57,000 by the early 2030s if Britain\u2019s headlong rush to Net Zero continues. For a city already bleeding skilled jobs \u2014 some 18,000 lost since 2010 \u2014 this is not an abstract climate model but the prospect of a living community turned into another deindustrialised ghost of Britain\u2019s past.\n\nThe GMB\u2019s Scotland Secretary, Louise Gilmour, has broken ranks with the political class by [calling](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25799287.despair-dereliction--aberdeen-jobs-cliff-edge-fears/) Ed Miliband\u2019s policies \u201cdelusional\u201d and warning that they risk \u201carguably the most destructive industrial calamity in our nation\u2019s history\u201d. Yet her intervention raises an uncomfortable question: how did a movement born to defend the English working class against economic dispossession become complicit in the very policies that now threaten to hollow out Aberdeen just as surely as coal-mining ",
