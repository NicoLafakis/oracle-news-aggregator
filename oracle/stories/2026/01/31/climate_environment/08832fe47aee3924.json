As a nation richly blessed with natural resources and abundant renewable energy potential, we have every opportunity to become an energy-secure and industrially competitive economy.\n\nYet, our power deficit continues to act as a bottleneck to sustainable growth, job creation, and the full realisation of Vision 2030.\n\nFor decades, underinvestment in the energy sector has constrained industrial capacity, undermined investor confidence, and forced Zimbabwe to rely on costly power imports.\n\nTo break this cycle, Zimbabwe must act boldly and decisively. One practical, transformative solution is the establishment of an Energy Emergency Fund (EEF) \u2014 a dedicated financing mechanism that would catalyse investment, de-risk projects, and accelerate energy generation and distribution.\n\n**Why an EEF is urgent**\n\nAn EEF would not merely be a financial pool; it would be a national strategic instrument to stimulate investment in the energy sector. Its importance can be viewed across several critical dimensions:\n\n1. **Bridging the financing gap**\n\nZimbabwe requires billions of dollars in investment to close the energy deficit. Traditional public financing is insufficient.\n\nAn EEF would mobilise blended fi",
