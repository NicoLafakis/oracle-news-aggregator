On January 8th, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services [announced](https://www.ipbes.net/node/95839) that the U.S. intended to withdraw from participation. The IPBES chair was careful to separate politics from science: the decision, however consequential, does not alter the facts. More than one million species are threatened with extinction globally, and ecosystem degradation inflicts damage measured not in millions but in trillions of dollars each year.\n\nWhen it comes to biodiversity, the animals of concern are not just the charismatic specimens wheeled out for fundraising campaigns. Unglamorous species underpin water systems, agriculture, and territorial resilience. Seen in this light, biodiversity is a vital part of the planetary infrastructure.\n\nFor all the noise of partisan dispute, the United States has spent years treating biodiversity as a strategic asset.
