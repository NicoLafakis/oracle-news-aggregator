  "description": "Statins are a cornerstone of heart health, but muscle pain and weakness cause many patients to quit taking them. Scientists have now identified the precise molecular trigger behind these side effects. They found that statins jam open a critical muscle protein, causing a toxic calcium leak. The discovery could lead to safer statins that keep their life-saving benefits without the muscle damage.",
