Cases rose by 13% in 2024 and continued to climb through the first three quarters of 2025.**\n\n- Professor Onn Min Kon stated that \"productive young people in the prime of their lives\" are being severely affected by the disease. Some patients have been left unable to walk or paralyzed due to advanced infections.\n\n- While most TB affects the lungs, \"extra-pulmonary\" TB can attack the spine with devastating, life-changing consequences. Although spinal TB accounts for less than 10% of cases, the financial and rehabilitation implications are profound.\n\n- The warning follows a recent outbreak at an Amazon warehouse in Coventry, where 10 employees tested positive for the condition. This incident led to calls from union bosses for the facility to be temporarily closed for safety.\n\n- Experts suggest the increased severity of recent cases may be a \"carryover\" from the pandemic period. Many people initially attributed their chronic coughs to COVID-19, allowing infectious TB to reach much more advanced stages.\n\n- England is close to crossing the World Health Organisation's threshold for \"medium incidence\" countries. This would put the nation in the same category as countries like Albania, Romania, and Egypt for the firs",
