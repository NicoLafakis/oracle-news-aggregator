On top of everything else, he is \u201ccentral casting,\u201d and he will never let you down,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social. U.S. equity futures and Treasuries pared earlier losses following the announcement, with investors weighing how aggressively Warsh might cut interest rates. Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is preparing for the president to nominate Warsh as the next Fed chair. Warsh, who served as a policymaker from 2006 to 2011, frequently highlighted inflation risks even as others focused on supporting growth and employment during the financial crisis.\n\n### More News from Barchart\n\n- [PayPal Reports Q4 Earnings on Feb. 3.
