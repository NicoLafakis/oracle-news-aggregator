The S&P 500 sank 29.98 points, or 0.43 percent, to 6,939.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 223.31 points, or 0.94 percent, to 23,461.82.\n\nSeven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors closed in negative territory, with materials and technology posting the steepest losses at 1.85 percent and 1.33 percent, respectively. Consumer staples and energy outperformed, rising 1.35 percent and 0.98 percent.\n\nMarkets reacted to Trump's announcement that he has selected Warsh, a former Fed governor known for his hawkish stance, to lead the U.S. central bank. While Warsh has historically favored tighter policy, he has recently expressed support for rate cuts, aligning with Trump's repeated calls for aggressive monetary easing.\n\n\"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" Trump wrote on social media.\n\nWarsh has been critical of the Fed for being too activist and steering too far from its core mandate and for being myopic and too beholden to financial markets, noted Paul Sheard, economist and former vice chairman of S&P Global.\n\n\"Financial market participants will be ",
