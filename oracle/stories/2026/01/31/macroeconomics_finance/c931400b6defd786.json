Whether he can maintain the Fed's longtime independence from day-to-day politics while also placating Trump will be a tremendous challenge.\n\nStill, former associates and friends of Warsh say that he has the intellectual heft and people skills to potentially pull it off. His family also has connections to Trump that could reduce the pressure from the White House.\n\nWarsh has \"a judicious temperament and both the intellectual understanding but also the hopefully diplomatic talents to navigate what is a challenging position at this point,\" said Raghuram Rajan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and formerly head of India's central bank.\n\nWarsh would replace current chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May. Trump chose Powell to lead the Fed in 2017 but this year has relentlessly assailed him for not cutting interest rates quickly enough.\n\n\"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" Trump posted on social media Friday. \"On top of ",
