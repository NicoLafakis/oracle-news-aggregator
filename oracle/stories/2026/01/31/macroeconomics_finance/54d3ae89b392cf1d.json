The youth vote in particularly has been turning negative on this front. After all, have grocery prices really been coming down much?\n\nThat\u2019s now going to change.\n\nAccording to CNBC:\n\nThe decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a\u00a0fusillade of criticism\u00a0against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018.\n\n\u201cI have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\u201d Trump said\u00a0in a Truth Social post\u00a0announcing the selection.\n\nTrump\u2019s nomination of Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve\u00a0is just what the doctor\u00a0ordered\u00a0to really get the economy ",
