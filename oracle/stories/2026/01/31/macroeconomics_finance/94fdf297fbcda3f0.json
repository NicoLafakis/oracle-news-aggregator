American consumers and small businesses alike are spitting fire these days about the cost of credit cards, while the companies profiting from them are making money hand over fist.\n\nWe are now having a national conversation about what the federal government can do to lower the cost of credit cards. Sens. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, and Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, truly strange political bedfellows, have proposed a 10% cap. Now President Donald Trump has too. But we risk spinning our wheels if we do not face facts about the underlying structure of this market.\n\nWe should dispense with the notion that the credit card business in the United States is a free market with robust competition. Instead, we have an oligopoly of dominant banks that issue them: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, American Express, Citigroup and Capital One, which together account for about 70% of all transactions. And we have a duopoly of networks: Visa and Mastercard, who process more than 80% of those transactions.\n\nThe results are higher prices for consumers who use the cards and businesses that accept them.
