Women contribute only about 18% to India\u2019s GDP, not because they work less, but because a large share of their labour remains unpaid and uncounted in national income. About 40% of India\u2019s women are now in the labour force, largely concentrated in unpaid agricultural work, but 60% of women who are out of the labour force cite domestic and care responsibilities as the reason (Periodic Labour Force Survey data).\n\nThis is the result of a combination of supply-and-demand side constraints \u2014 care burdens, limited skills, mobility barriers, and restrictive social norms and limited creation of decent jobs to absorb women\u2019s time remuneratively. It is important, therefore, to explicitly value, free up, and productively redistribute women\u2019s time. The Uni",
