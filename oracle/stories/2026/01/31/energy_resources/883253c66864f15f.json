Arcodia holds a dual appointment within the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](https://atmospheric-sciences.earth.miami.edu/index.html) and the [Frost Institute for Data Science and Computing](https://idsc.miami.edu/). \"Through explainable AI, we can also identify the environmental factors driving those predictions at each reef site.\"\n\n\"Our model identifies potential factors that influence thermal stress at a given reef site,\" said Richard Karp, a co-author and post-doctoral research associate at the Rosenstiel School's [Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies](https://cimas.earth.miami.edu/), \"This information gives managers an opportunity to identify trigger points in emergency action plans, which can support planning and response decisions.\"\n\nThe research team combined atmospheric science, coral ecology, and data science to build a prediction tool tailored to Florida's Coral Reef.\n\n### Localized AI predictions on actionable timescales\n\nUsing an [XGBoost machine-learning](https://en.wikip",
