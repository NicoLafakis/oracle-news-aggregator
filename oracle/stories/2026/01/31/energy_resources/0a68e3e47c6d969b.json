That\u2019s the lowest tonnage shipped through the port since 1938, according to season end figures released Friday by the Duluth Seaway Port Authority.\n\nCanadian trade dropped 41 percent across all cargoes, and overseas trade fell 30 percent to its lowest level since the St. Lawrence Seaway opened in 1959. The amount of grain moving through the port also dropped to roughly 560,000 tons, [the lowest level seen since 1890](https://duluthport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tonnage-Tonnage-Totals-History-Grand-Totals-YE-2024.pdf).\n\n## News with a little more humanity\n\nWPR\u2019s \u201cWisconsin Today\u201d newsletter keeps you connected to the state you love without feeling overwhelmed.

But shipments dropped 15 percent to [16.5 million tons](https://duluthport.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tonnage-2025-Season-January-2026.pdf) last year. A 2.5 million-ton drop in iron ore exports to Canada made up most of the decline amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war.\n\nThe port faced challenges at the season\u2019s outset, said Kevin Beardsley, executive director of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority.\n\n\u201cMines were being idl",
