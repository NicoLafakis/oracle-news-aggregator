I\u2019d sum up what I remember something like this: Americans consume one hell of a lot \u2014 cars, clothes, food, toys, expensive private colleges (ahem\u2026), and that\u2019s just to start. Since other\u00a0[countries](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/20-countries-holding-most-us-debt-2025-and-how-it-impacts-your-wallet?utm_)\u00a0like China, the United Kingdom, and Japan\u00a0[purchase](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-us-government-debt-is-owned-by-other-countries/country/united-states/)\u00a0substantial chunks of U.S. consumer debt, they have a vested interest in our economic stability.
