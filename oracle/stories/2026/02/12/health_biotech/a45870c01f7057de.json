  "description": "A simple brain-training program that sharpens how quickly older adults process visual information may have a surprisingly powerful long-term payoff. In a major 20-year study of adults 65 and older, those who completed five to six weeks of adaptive \u201cspeed of processing\u201d training \u2014 along with a few booster sessions \u2014 were significantly less likely to develop dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, even two decades later. Participants who received the boosted speed training had a 25% lower dementia risk compared to those who received no training, making it the only intervention in the trial to show such a lasting protective effect.",
