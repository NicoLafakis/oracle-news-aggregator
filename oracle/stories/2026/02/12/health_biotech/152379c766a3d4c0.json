  "description": "A newly identified protein may hold the key to rejuvenating aging brain cells. Researchers found that boosting DMTF1 can restore the ability of neural stem cells to regenerate, even when age-related damage has set in. Without it, these cells struggle to renew and support memory and learning. The findings raise hopes for treatments that could slow or even reverse aspects of brain aging.",
