  "description": "A new clinical trial suggests that changing when you eat could make a meaningful difference for people living with Crohn\u2019s disease. Researchers found that time-restricted feeding, a form of intermittent fasting that limits meals to an 8-hour daily window, reduced disease activity by 40% and cut abdominal discomfort in half over 12 weeks. Participants also lost weight and showed healthier inflammation and immune markers, even though they did not reduce calories or change what they ate.",
