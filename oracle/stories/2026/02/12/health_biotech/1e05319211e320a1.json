  "description": "A six-week study from the University of Nottingham suggests that pairing fermented kefir with a diverse prebiotic fiber mix may deliver a powerful anti-inflammatory boost. This \u201csynbiotic\u201d combination outperformed omega-3 supplements and fiber alone, leading to the broadest drop in inflammation-related proteins in healthy adults. By feeding beneficial microbes and helping them produce compounds like butyrate, the combo appeared to improve overall immune balance and metabolic health.",
