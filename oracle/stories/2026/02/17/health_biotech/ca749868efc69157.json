  "description": "Researchers have identified two brain receptors that help the brain clear away amyloid beta, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. By stimulating these receptors in mice, scientists increased levels of a natural amyloid-breaking enzyme, reduced buildup in the brain, and improved memory-related behavior. Because these receptors are common drug targets, the findings could open the door to affordable pill-based treatments with fewer side effects.",
