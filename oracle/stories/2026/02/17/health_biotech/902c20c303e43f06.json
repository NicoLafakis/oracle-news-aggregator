  "description": "A mysterious RNA found in breast cancer led scientists to uncover an entire hidden class of cancer-specific RNAs across dozens of tumor types. These molecules form unique molecular signatures that identify cancer type and subtype with remarkable accuracy. Some even drive tumor growth and metastasis. Because many are released into the bloodstream, a simple blood test can track how patients respond to treatment and predict survival.",
