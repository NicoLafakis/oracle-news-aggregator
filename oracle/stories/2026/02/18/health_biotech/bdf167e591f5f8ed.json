  "description": "Northwestern researchers have shown that when it comes to cancer vaccines, arrangement can be just as important as ingredients. By repositioning a small fragment of an HPV protein on a DNA-based nanovaccine, the team dramatically strengthened the immune system\u2019s attack on HPV-driven tumors. One specific design slowed tumor growth, extended survival in animal models, and unleashed far more cancer-killing T cells than other versions made with the exact same components.",
