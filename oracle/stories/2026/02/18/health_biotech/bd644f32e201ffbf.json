Now, scientists at UC San Diego have unveiled a powerful new CRISPR-based tool that doesn\u2019t just fight resistant bacteria\u2014it can actively strip away their drug resistance. Inspired by gene drives used in insects, the technology spreads a genetic \u201cfix\u201d through bacterial populations, even inside stubborn biofilms that shield microbes from antibiotics.",
