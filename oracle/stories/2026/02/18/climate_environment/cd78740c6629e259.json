  "description": "Ocean waves are a vast and steady source of renewable energy, but capturing their power efficiently has long frustrated engineers. A researcher at The University of Osaka has now explored a bold new approach: a gyroscopic wave energy converter that uses a spinning flywheel inside a floating structure to turn wave motion into electricity. By harnessing gyroscopic precession\u2014the subtle wobble of a spinning object under force\u2014the system can be tuned to absorb energy across a wide range of wave conditions.",
