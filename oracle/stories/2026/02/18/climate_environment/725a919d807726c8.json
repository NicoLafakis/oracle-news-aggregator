  "description": "As the planet warms, many expected ecosystems to change faster and faster. Instead, a massive global study shows that species turnover has slowed by about one-third since the 1970s. Nature\u2019s constant reshuffling appears to be driven more by internal ecological dynamics than by climate alone. The slowdown may signal something alarming: ecosystems losing the biodiversity needed to keep their engines running.",
