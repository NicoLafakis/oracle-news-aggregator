  "description": "New residential construction in the US rose to a five-month high in December, as homebuilders boosted production to take advantage of lower borrowing costs. Housing starts\u00a0increased 6.2% to an annual pace of 1.4 million homes in December, according to figures released Wednesday by the government, which were delayed by fall\u2019s federal shutdown. That beat all estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The advance was broad-based, with both\u00a0single-family\u00a0home starts and apartment projects rising at year\u2019s end. The number of one-family homes started was the highest since February.\u00a0Kamini Lane, President and CEO of Coldwell Banker Realty, joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. Lane also weighs in on this week's mortgage rate data, the current real estate market in cities like Los Angeles, and more. She speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)",
