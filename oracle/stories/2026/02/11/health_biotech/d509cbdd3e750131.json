New research shows the answer lies in a molecular record etched into our immune cells by both our genes and our life experiences. Scientists at the Salk Institute have created a detailed epigenetic map of human immune cells, revealing how inherited traits and past exposures\u2014like infections, vaccines, or even environmental chemicals\u2014shape immune responses in different ways.",
