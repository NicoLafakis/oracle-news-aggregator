  "description": "President Donald Trump is privately musing about exiting the North American trade pact, people familiar with the matter said, injecting further uncertainty about the deal\u2019s future into pivotal renegotiations involving the US, Canada and Mexico. The president has asked aides why he shouldn\u2019t withdraw from the agreement, which he signed during his first term, though he has stopped short of flatly signaling that he will do so, according to the people who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. A White House official, asked about the discussions, described Trump as the ultimate decision-maker and someone always seeking a better deal for the American people. Discussion about potential action amounted to baseless speculation before an announcement from the president, the official said. Bloomberg News White House Editor Jordan Fabian joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily. He speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)",
