  "description": "Aaron Jagdfeld, Chairman, President and CEO of Generac, joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss their recent earnings, the state of manufacturing in America, and US trade policy impact. Jagfeld attributed their earnings primarily to significantly reduced outage activity in the latter half of 2025. Jagfeld explained that the residential segment, which includes portable and standby generators, is heavily influenced by weather conditions, with outage hours in the back half of the year down 90% compared to the previous year. Looking ahead to 2025, Jagfeld expressed confidence in mid-teens growth, anticipating a return to more typical outage patterns and citing early-year weather events as a positive sign. He also emphasized the resilience of consumer demand for Generac's products, noting that power outages tend to make generators a priority purchase regardless of broader economic concerns.
