Scientists have discovered that Belgica antarctica \u2014 a tiny, rice-sized midge and the southernmost insect on Earth \u2014 is already ingesting microplastics in the wild. While lab tests showed the hardy larvae can survive short-term exposure without obvious harm, those exposed to higher plastic levels had reduced fat reserves, hinting at hidden energy costs.",
