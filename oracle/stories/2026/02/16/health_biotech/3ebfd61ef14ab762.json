  "description": "For years, compulsive behaviors have been viewed as bad habits stuck on autopilot. But new research in rats found the opposite: inflammation in a key decision-making brain region actually made behavior more deliberate, not more automatic. The change was linked to astrocytes, brain support cells that multiplied and disrupted nearby circuits. The discovery hints that some compulsive behaviors may arise from excessive, misdirected control rather than a loss of it.",
