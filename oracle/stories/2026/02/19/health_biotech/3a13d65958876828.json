  "description": "Myopia is skyrocketing around the world, often blamed on endless screen time \u2014 but new research suggests the real culprit may be something more subtle. Scientists at SUNY College of Optometry propose that it\u2019s not just devices, but the combination of prolonged close-up focus and dim indoor lighting that may quietly strain the eyes. When we concentrate on nearby objects in low light, our pupils constrict in a way that may reduce how much light reaches the retina, potentially triggering changes that lead to nearsightedness.",
