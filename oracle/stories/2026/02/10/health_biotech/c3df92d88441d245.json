Researchers at the University of Geneva found that neutrophils\u2014normally frontline defenders against infection\u2014can be reprogrammed inside tumors to fuel cancer growth instead. Once exposed to the tumor environment, these immune cells begin producing a molecule called CCL3 that actively promotes tumor progression.",
