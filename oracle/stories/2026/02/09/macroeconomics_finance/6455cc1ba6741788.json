  "description": "Bloomberg News Health Reporter Madison Muller reports on the latest on Novo's lawsuit. -\u00a0Novo Nordisk\u00a0said it\u2019s suing\u00a0Hims & Hers Health Inc.\u00a0for making knock-offs of its obesity medicines, even as Hims scrapped plans to sell a copycat version of the Wegovy pill. Hims is breaching the US patent on semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo\u2019s blockbuster obesity treatments, Novo argued Monday. The US lawsuit attacks not only Hims\u2019 new strategy to launch a copycat pill but also goes after shots that mimic Wegovy and its sister drug Ozempic.\nThe move marks a more aggressive approach for Novo under Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Mike Doustdar. Until now, the drugmaker\u2019s legal strategy focused on the way that companies like Hims market their products. Novo said this is the first time it has sued over patent infringement for compounded semaglutide. (Source: Bloomberg)",
