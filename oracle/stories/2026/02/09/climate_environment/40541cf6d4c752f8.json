  "description": "A common iron mineral hiding in soil turns out to be far better at trapping carbon than scientists realized. Its surface isn\u2019t uniform \u2014 it\u2019s a nanoscale patchwork of positive and negative charges that can grab many different organic molecules. Instead of relying on a single weak attraction, the mineral uses several bonding strategies to hold carbon tightly in place. This helps explain how soils store enormous amounts of carbon for the long term.",
