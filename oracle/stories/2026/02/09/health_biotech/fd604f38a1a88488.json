  "description": "A new international study points to a specific brain network as the core driver of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Scientists found that this network becomes overly connected, disrupting not just movement but also thinking and other bodily functions. When researchers targeted it with non-invasive brain stimulation, patients showed much stronger symptom improvement than with conventional stimulation. The discovery could reshape how Parkinson\u2019s is diagnosed and treated.",
