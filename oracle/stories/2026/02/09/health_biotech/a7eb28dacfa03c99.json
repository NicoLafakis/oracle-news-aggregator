  "description": "Scientists have discovered why ovarian cancer spreads so rapidly through the abdomen. Cancer cells enlist normally protective abdominal cells, forming mixed groups that work together to invade new tissue. These helper cells lead the way, allowing cancer to spread faster and resist chemotherapy. The findings uncover a critical weakness that future treatments may target.",
