  "description": "A long-term study found that women who closely followed a Mediterranean diet had a much lower risk of stroke. The strongest benefits were seen in women who ate more plant-based foods, fish, and olive oil while cutting back on red meat and saturated fats. Their risk dropped across all major stroke types, including bleeding strokes, which are less commonly studied. The findings suggest diet may be a powerful but overlooked factor in stroke prevention.",
