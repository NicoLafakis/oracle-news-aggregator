  "description": "Running extreme distances may strain more than just muscles and joints. New research suggests ultramarathons can alter red blood cells in ways that make them less flexible and more prone to breakdown, potentially interfering with how they deliver oxygen throughout the body. Scientists found signs of both mechanical stress from intense blood flow and molecular damage linked to inflammation and oxidative stress.",
