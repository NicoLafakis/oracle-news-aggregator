  "description": "A common bacterium best known for causing pneumonia and sinus infections may also play a surprising role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Researchers found that Chlamydia pneumoniae can invade the retina and brain, where it sparks inflammation, nerve cell death, and the buildup of amyloid-beta\u2014the hallmark protein linked to Alzheimer\u2019s. Higher levels of the bacterium were found in people with Alzheimer\u2019s, especially those carrying the high-risk APOE4 gene, and were tied to more severe cognitive decline.",
