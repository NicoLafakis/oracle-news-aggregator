My devotion to Southwest Airlines has been undeniable. I have used the airline so many times that I actually have a favorite flight. It's the first flight out every day from BNA (Nashville International) to LGA (LaGuardia) in New York City. It's exceptionally convenient and dependable. It's cheap. It's quick. It gets me to LaGuardia in about two hours. From LaGuardia, I can hop on the Q70 bus and take the LaGuardia Airlink to the Jackson Heights/Roosevelt Avenue subway stop. From there, I can hop on a World Trade Center-bound E Express train and be in Manhattan- specifically the stops in Hell's Kitchen- within an hour of landing. That flight is money. Of course, before this week, the word 'money' was more figurative than literal.\n\n### **SOUTHWEST AIRLINES BAGGAGE FEES**\n\nSee, my loyalty to Southwest has wavered considerably in the last year. First of all, the airline's now charging for bags, when you used to be able to check two of them- per passenger- for free.\n\n![Scott Olson/Getty Images](https://townsquare.media/site/76/f",
