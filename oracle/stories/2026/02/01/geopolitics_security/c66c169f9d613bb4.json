What looks like a spending cycle on paper is, on the ground, a fast-moving redesign of how work gets done, how factories run, and how services reach customers. The appetite for **Investment** is being fueled by a rare combination of forces: ambitious industrial policy, dense manufacturing supply chains, pragmatic enterprise buyers, and a generation of engineers trained to deploy **Machine Learning** in production rather than prototypes. The spotlight has shifted from \u201cexperimentation\u201d to \u201coperations,\u201d and the winners are increasingly those who can connect models to workflows, sensors, and audited governance.\n\nSummary\n\nAcross the region, the most compelling story isn\u2019t only about chatbots or consumer apps. It is about **Automation** becoming a strategic layer in logistics, clinical operations, and finance\u2014often orchestrated by \u201cagentic\u201d systems that can plan, execute, and escalate decisions with limited human input. This is why capital is flowing not just into software, but into chips, edge devices, robotics integrators, cloud security, and data infrastructure. The practical question for leaders is no longer \u201cShould we do Artificial Intelligence?\u201d but \u201cWhich process, which site, which risk boundary, and which partner?\u201d\n\n- **Asia** is accelerating operational deployments of **Artificial Intelligence**, shifting budg",
