Photo: SpaceX\n\nElon Musk\u2019s SpaceX has proposed launching an unprecedented constellation of up to 1 million satellites to orbit Earth and power artificial intelligence data centers using solar energy, according to a filing submitted to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The plan, if approved, would mark one of the most ambitious expansions of space-based infrastructure ever contemplated.\n\nThe filing was made public on Friday, one day after reports that SpaceX and Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence startup xAI are in discussions about a potential merger ahead of a major public offering expected later this year. Such a combination could accelerate SpaceX\u2019s vision of moving large-scale computing infrastructure into orbit, positioning Musk more aggressively in the intensifying AI race against rivals including Google, Meta and OpenAI.\n\nData centers are the physical backbone of modern artificial intelligence, but they consume enormous amounts of electricity and generate significant heat and emissions. In its filing, SpaceX argued that orbiting facilities powered by near-constant sunlight could fundamentally change the economics and environmental footprint of AI infrastructure.\n\nBy harnessing solar power directly in space, the satellites could operate with minimal maintenance costs while sharply reducing the environmental impact associated with land-based data centers, the company said. SpaceX would require regulatory approval from the FCC before proceeding with any such deployment.\n\nIndustry experts note that the headline figure of 1 million satellites is unlikel",
