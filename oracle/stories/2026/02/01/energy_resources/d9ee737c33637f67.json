Brent was trading around $70 on January 30 and averaged around $68.20 last year.\n\nU.S. crude is projected to average $58.72 per barrel, compared with December's estimate of $58.15. Prices averaged $64.73 in 2025.\n\nGeopolitics are at the fore following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to Iran, expanded sanctions on Russia, and unrest across the Middle East. All pose supply risks.\n\nHowever, analysts said U.S. trade policy shifts, China\u2019s demand trajectory, and OPEC+\u2019s next steps will also steer prices this year.\n\n\"Geopolitics brings lots of noise but neither the events in Venezuela nor Iran should ultimately alter the big picture. The oil market appears to be in a lasting surplus,\" said Norbert Ruecker, head of economics & next generation research at Julius Baer.\n\nAnalysts expect that surplus to range from 0.75 to 3.5 million barrels per day.\n\nAnalysts broadly expect it to take years for any major increase in production from Venezuela after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nKpler anticipates Venezuelan supply will dip through April because of the U.S. crackdown on tankers under sanctions, but that it will rebound in the second half of the year as existing infrastructure is reactivated.\n\nAny increases in oil production beyond this will require sustained investment, prolonged politica",
