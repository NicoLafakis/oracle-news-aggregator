This is no small development. These two countries are the world's largest coal consumers and, over the past decade, were responsible for a staggering 93% of the increase in global carbon dioxide emissions from power generation. Yet, record additions of renewable energy capacity \u2014\u00a0particularly solar and wind \u2014\u00a0helped both economies meet rising electricity demand without a corresponding rise in emissions. China cut power-sector emissions by 40 million tonnes, while India achieved a sharper relative drop of over 4% within a year.\n\nThe lesson for Pakistan could not be clearer. Even coal-heavy, rapidly growing economies have begun bending the emissions curve through aggressive clean energy deployment. Pakistan, by contrast, continues to crawl at a snail's pace \u2014\u00a0paralysed by policy contradictions, fiscal short-termism and a deepening structural crisis in its power sector. The paradox is that on one hand, Pakistan is drowning in circular debt, which has crossed alarming thresholds and conti",
