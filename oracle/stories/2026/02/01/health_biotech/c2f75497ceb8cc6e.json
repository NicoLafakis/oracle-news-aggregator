  "description": "When the brain rests, it usually replays recent experiences to strengthen memory. Scientists found that in Alzheimer\u2019s-like mice, this replay still occurs \u2014 but the signals are jumbled and poorly coordinated. As a result, memory-supporting brain cells lose their stability, and the animals struggle to remember where they\u2019ve been.",
