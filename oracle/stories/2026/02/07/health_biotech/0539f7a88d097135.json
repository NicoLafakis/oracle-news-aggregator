  "description": "New research suggests that Epstein-Barr virus may actively provoke the immune system in people with multiple sclerosis. Scientists found large buildups of virus-targeting immune cells in the nervous systems of MS patients, far more than in their blood. One viral gene was active only in people with MS, hinting at a direct role in the disease. The findings could help guide new approaches to treatment.",
