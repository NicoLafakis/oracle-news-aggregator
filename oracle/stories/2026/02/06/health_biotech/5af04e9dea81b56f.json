  "description": "Colorectal cancer has long baffled scientists because, unlike most tumors, patients often do better when their cancers are packed with immune-suppressing regulatory T cells. New research finally explains why. Scientists discovered that these T cells aren\u2019t all the same: one subtype actually helps keep tumors in check, while another shields cancer from immune attack. The balance between these \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d cells can determine whether a tumor grows or shrinks.",
