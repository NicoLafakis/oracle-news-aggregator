  "description": "A new imaging breakthrough combines ultrasound and light-based techniques to generate vivid 3D images that show both tissue structure and blood vessel activity. Developed by researchers at Caltech and USC, the system delivers detailed results quickly and without radiation or contrast dyes. It has already been used to image multiple parts of the human body. The approach could significantly improve cancer detection, nerve-damage monitoring, and brain imaging.",
