  "description": "Scientists at Keck Medicine of USC are testing an experimental stem cell therapy that aims to restore the brain\u2019s ability to produce dopamine, the chemical whose loss drives Parkinson\u2019s disease. The early-stage clinical trial involves implanting lab-grown dopamine-producing cells directly into a key movement-control region of the brain, with the hope of slowing disease progression and improving motor function.",
