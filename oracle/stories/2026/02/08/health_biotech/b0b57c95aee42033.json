Scientists found that a natural compound made by healthy gut bacteria dramatically reduced fatty liver disease in the offspring of mice whose mothers ate a high-fat, high-sugar diet. The compound, called indole, appeared to protect the liver, improve blood sugar, limit weight gain, and even reshape the gut microbiome in lasting ways.",
