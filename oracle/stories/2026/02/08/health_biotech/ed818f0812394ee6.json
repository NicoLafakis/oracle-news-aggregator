  "description": "Scientists have uncovered promising clues that compounds found in Aloe vera could play a role in fighting Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Using advanced computer modeling, researchers discovered that beta-sitosterol\u2014a natural plant compound\u2014strongly interacts with two key enzymes involved in memory loss and cognitive decline. The compound showed stability, strong binding, and favorable safety indicators, making it a standout candidate for future drug development.",
