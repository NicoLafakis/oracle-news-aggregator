  "description": "Scientists have identified a promising new compound, Mic-628, that can reliably shift the body\u2019s internal clock forward\u2014something that\u2019s notoriously hard to do. By targeting a key clock-control protein, Mic-628 jump-starts the gene that sets daily rhythms, synchronizing both the brain\u2019s master clock and clocks throughout the body. In mice experiencing simulated jet lag, a single dose cut recovery time nearly in half.",
