  "description": "Breathing polluted air may do more than harm your lungs \u2014 it could also increase your risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In a sweeping study of nearly 28 million older Americans, researchers found that long term exposure to fine particle air pollution was linked to a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. The connection appeared to stem largely from pollution\u2019s direct effects on the brain, rather than through related health conditions like hypertension or depression.",
