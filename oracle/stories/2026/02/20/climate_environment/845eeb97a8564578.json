  "description": "Scientists at Stanford have unveiled the first-ever global map of rare earthquakes that rumble deep within Earth\u2019s mantle rather than its crust. Long debated and notoriously difficult to confirm, these elusive quakes turn out to cluster in regions like the Himalayas and near the Bering Strait. By developing a breakthrough method that distinguishes mantle quakes using subtle differences in seismic waves, researchers identified hundreds of these hidden tremors worldwide.",
