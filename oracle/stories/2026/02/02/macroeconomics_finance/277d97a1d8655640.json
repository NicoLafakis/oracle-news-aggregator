  "description": "Gil Luria, Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at DA Davidson, joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss Palantir earnings, including the firm's better-than-expected forecast revenue for fiscal 2026 that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations, a boost for the data analytics company after its shares have gotten off to a lackluster start so far this year. Annual revenue will be between $7.18 billion and $7.2 billion, the Denver-based company said Monday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $6.27 billion. Luria also weighs in as Elon Musk\u2019s\u00a0SpaceX\u00a0announces it will acquire\u00a0xAI, in a deal that encompasses the billionaire\u2019s increasingly costly ambitions to dominate artificial intelligence and space exploration. The transaction was announced in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on SpaceX\u2019s website signed by Musk, and confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News\u00a0report.\u00a0Luria speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.
