  "description": "Chronic stress can damage the gut\u2019s protective lining, triggering inflammation that may worsen depression. New research shows that stress lowers levels of a protein called Reelin, which plays a key role in both gut repair and brain health. Remarkably, a single injection restored Reelin levels and produced antidepressant-like effects in preclinical models. The findings hint at a future treatment that targets depression through the gut\u2013brain connection.",
