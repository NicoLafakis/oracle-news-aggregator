  "description": "AI is already reshaping the value of human expertise, but its effects on workers aren\u2019t predetermined. MIT professor David Autor says the key question isn\u2019t what jobs can be automated, but which tasks within a job are automated and who benefits from that shift. In some cases, AI can increase wages and productivity; in others, it can lower barriers to entry, intensify competition and compress pay. Stanford professor Erik Brynjolfsson discusses whether AI will widen inequality or expand opportunity, and how policymakers can steer its development. (Source: Bloomberg)",
