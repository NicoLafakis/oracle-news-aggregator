  "description": "Scientists have uncovered a hidden partnership between pancreatic cancer and the nervous system. Support cells in the pancreas lure nerve fibers, which then release signals that accelerate early cancer growth. This creates a self-sustaining loop that helps tumors take hold. Blocking the nerve activity significantly reduced tumor growth in experiments, suggesting a new treatment strategy.",
