  "description": "Scientists at Cedars-Sinai have uncovered a surprising repair system in the spinal cord that could open new doors for treating paralysis, stroke, and diseases like multiple sclerosis. They found that special support cells called astrocytes\u2014located far from the actual injury\u2014spring into action after damage. These \u201clesion-remote astrocytes\u201d send out a protein signal, CCN1, that reprograms immune cells to efficiently clean up fatty nerve debris.",
