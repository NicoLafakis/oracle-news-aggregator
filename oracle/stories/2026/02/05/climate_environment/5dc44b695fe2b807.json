  "description": "Deep inside Earth, two massive hot rock structures have been quietly shaping the planet\u2019s magnetic field for millions of years. Using ancient magnetic records and advanced simulations, scientists discovered that these formations influence the movement of liquid iron in Earth\u2019s core. Some parts of the magnetic field remained stable over vast stretches of time, while others changed dramatically.",
