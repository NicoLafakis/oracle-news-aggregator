  "description": "Researchers have created the first complete map showing how hundreds of mutations in a key cancer gene affect tumor growth. By testing every possible mutation in a critical hotspot, they found that some changes barely boost cancer signals, while others supercharge them. When matched against real patient data, the map accurately predicted cancer behavior across tissues.",
