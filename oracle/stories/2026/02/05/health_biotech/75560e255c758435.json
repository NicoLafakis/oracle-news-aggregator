New research shows that even \u201cnormal\u201d kidney test results can signal danger if they\u2019re unusually low for someone\u2019s age. By mapping kidney function across the population, scientists revealed who\u2019s quietly at higher risk. A new online tool could help doctors catch these warning signs years earlier.",
