  "description": "Advanced care provided by air ambulance teams was linked to higher survival rates in major trauma patients. Researchers found that more people survived than predicted by standard models, including many with severe injuries and low chances of survival. Younger patients and those more responsive at first assessment benefited most. Outcomes for traumatic cardiac arrest also improved steadily over the study period.",
