# Node N88: EU AI Act Enters Full Force - Risk-Based Regulation Begins

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N88
- **Description**: The EU AI Act, the world's first comprehensive AI regulatory framework, began enforcement in 2025 with prohibited AI systems banned from February and General Purpose AI Model (GPAI) rules taking effect in August. The risk-based framework categorizes AI by harm potential with extraterritorial reach affecting global AI companies.
- **Verification_Status**: **Verified** ✅
- **Date**: February 2025 (prohibitions), August 2025 (GPAI rules)
- **Scope**: Global AI regulation, technology governance, compliance

## **Verified Context from Research**

### **Key Provisions:**
**Prohibited AI (February 2025):**
- Manipulative subliminal techniques
- Social scoring systems
- Predictive crime algorithms
- Emotion recognition in certain contexts

**High-Risk AI Requirements:**
- Transparency obligations
- Human oversight requirements
- Conformity assessments
- Documentation and logging

**GPAI Rules (August 2025):**
- Foundation model transparency
- Systemic risk assessment for large models
- Training compute thresholds trigger extra obligations
- Copyright and content documentation

### **Enforcement:**
- **Fines**: Up to €35 million or 7% global revenue
- **Scope**: Extraterritorial (applies to non-EU providers)
- **Delays**: Digital Omnibus Package extended deadlines 16 months
- **Regulators**: National authorities + EU AI Office

## **Generated Ripple Effects**

### **First-Order Effects (Confidence: 95%)**
- **Ripple 1A**: Global AI companies adapt products for EU compliance
- **Ripple 1B**: AI development practices shift toward documentation
- **Ripple 1C**: Compliance industry for AI regulation emerges
- **Ripple 1D**: Some AI features restricted or unavailable in EU

### **Second-Order Effects (Confidence: 90%)**
- **Ripple 2A**: Brussels Effect exports AI rules globally
- **Ripple 2B**: US and China regulatory responses accelerate
- **Ripple 2C**: AI safety research gains commercial importance
- **Ripple 2D**: Smaller AI companies face compliance burdens

### **Third-Order Effects (Confidence: 85%)**
- **Ripple 3A**: AI development potentially slows in regulated markets
- **Ripple 3B**: Innovation migrates to less regulated jurisdictions
- **Ripple 3C**: AI governance becomes standard corporate function
- **Ripple 3D**: Trust in AI systems potentially increases

### **Thread T311: N88 → N79/N81 (GPT-5/Gemini Face GPAI Rules)**
- **Relationship**: *regulates*
- **Confidence**: 95%
- **Rationale**: Major foundation models explicitly covered by GPAI provisions
- **Evidence**: Training compute thresholds capture leading models

### **Thread T312: N88 → N41 (Medical AI Faces High-Risk Classification)**
- **Relationship**: *constrains*
- **Confidence**: 90%
- **Rationale**: Healthcare AI classified as high-risk under EU AI Act
- **Evidence**: Medical diagnosis explicitly listed as high-risk application

## **Critical Strategic Implications**

### **The Brussels Effect:**
EU regulation sets global standards:
- **Market Size**: EU's 450M consumers matter to global companies
- **Compliance Choice**: Easier to build compliant by default
- **Precedent**: Other jurisdictions may adopt similar frameworks
- **Standard Setting**: EU shapes global AI governance norms

### **Competitive Implications:**
Regulation creates winners and losers:
- **Large Players**: Can afford compliance investments
- **Startups**: Burden may slow innovation
- **European AI**: Potentially constrained vs. US/China competitors
- **Safety Focus**: Companies investing in safety gain advantage

### **US-EU Divergence:**
Contrasting regulatory approaches:
- **EU**: Comprehensive, mandatory, risk-based
- **US**: Sectoral, voluntary, agency-led
- **China**: State-controlled, ideologically aligned
- **Fragmentation**: Companies navigate patchwork of rules
