# Node N708: Scientists find a massive hidden CO2 sponge beneath the ocean floor

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N708
- **Description**: Researchers found that eroded lava rubble beneath the South Atlantic can trap enormous amounts of CO2 for tens of millions of years. These porous breccia deposits store far more carbon than previously sampled ocean crust. The discovery reshapes how scientists view the long-term balance of carbon between the ocean, rocks, and atmosphere. It also reveals a hidden mechanism that helps stabilize Ea...
