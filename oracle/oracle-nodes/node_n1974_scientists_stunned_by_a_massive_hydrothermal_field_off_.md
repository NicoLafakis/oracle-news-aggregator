# Node N1974: Scientists stunned by a massive hydrothermal field off Greece

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N1974
- **Description**: Scientists have uncovered an extensive underwater vent system near Milos, Greece, hidden along active fault lines beneath the seafloor. These geological fractures act as pathways for hot, gas-rich fluids to escape, forming clusters of vents with striking visual diversity. The discovery surprised researchers, who observed boiling fluids and vibrant microbial mats during deep-sea dives. Milos now...
