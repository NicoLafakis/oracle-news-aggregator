### **Technical Architecture:**
- **Embedding System**: Creates "embedding fields" — highly compressed digital summaries capturing essential characteristics of Earth's surface
- **64-Dimensional Representation**: The 64 "bands" represent a 64-dimensional coordinate on the surface of a 64-dimensional "sphere"
- **Multi-source Fusion**: Assimilates optical and thermal imagery from Sentinel-2 and Landsat, radar data, 3D measurements, elevation models, climate information, gravity fields, and descriptive text
- **Space Time Precision (STP)**: Architecture that simultaneously maintains highly localized representations while modeling long-distance relationships through time and space

### **Real-World Impact:**
- **Partner Testing**: Over 50 organizations tested the dataset on real-world applications over the past year
- **Ecuador Example**: Model sees through persistent cloud cover to detail agricultural plots in various stages of development
- **Antarctica Mapping**: Maps complex surface in area notoriously difficult to image due to irregular satellite imaging
- **Agricultural Analysis**: Makes apparent variations in Canadian agricultural land use invisible to the naked eye

### **Data Access:**
- **Google Earth Engine**: Collection of AlphaEarth Foundations' annual embeddings released as the Satellite Embedding dataset
- **Time Coverage**: Baseline data sets covering Earth during the years 2017–24
- **Analysis-Ready**: Unlike traditional deep learning models requiring fine-tuning, produces information-rich, 64-dimensional embeddings suitable for use with Earth Engine's built-in classifiers
