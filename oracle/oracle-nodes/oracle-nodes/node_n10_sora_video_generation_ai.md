## **The Oracle's Assessment**

**N10 extends the AI revolution from text and images into video—the medium that most shapes human perception of reality.**

Sora's significance lies not in its current capabilities but in what it portends. If AI can generate convincing video from text, the concept of "seeing is believing" becomes obsolete. We are entering an era where visual evidence can be fabricated at will.
