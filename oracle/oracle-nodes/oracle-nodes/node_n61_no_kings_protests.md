### **Thread T165: N61 → N59 (AI Agents in Communication)**
- **Relationship**: *enabled by*
- **Confidence**: 85%
- **Rationale**: The ability to coordinate 7 million people across 2,700 cities without centralized leadership suggests the use of AI Agent swarms (N59) for logistics, message discipline, and routing.

## **Critical Strategic Implications**
- **The 3.5% Rule**: Political science suggests 3.5% of the population actively protesting ensures change. At 2%, the US is dangerously close to a tipping point of civil revision.
