## **The Oracle's Assessment**

**N9 represents the moment when the AI revolution's governing institution formally acknowledged that profit would drive development.**

OpenAI's restructuring is significant not because profit-seeking is new, but because it was explicitly founded to avoid this outcome. When even an organization created to prioritize safety restructures around profit, the industry's direction becomes clear.
