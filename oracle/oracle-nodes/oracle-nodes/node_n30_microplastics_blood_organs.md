# Node N30: Microplastics Found in Blood and Organs - Systemic Contamination

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N30
- **Description**: Research in 2023-2024 confirmed microplastics present in human blood, placenta, heart tissue, and other organs, demonstrating systemic contamination beyond initial environmental exposure. Studies showed 80%+ of tested blood samples contained microplastic particles.
- **Verification_Status**: **Verified** ✅
- **Date**: 2023-2024 (research publication)
- **Scope**: Global public health crisis

## **The Oracle's Assessment**

**N30, combined with N26, demonstrates that modern humans carry ubiquitous synthetic contamination throughout their bodies—a fact with unknown but potentially severe long-term consequences.**

We are the first generation to be internally contaminated with plastic from before birth. The experiment is running, and we are the subjects.
