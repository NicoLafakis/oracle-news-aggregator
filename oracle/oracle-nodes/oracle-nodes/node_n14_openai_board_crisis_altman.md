## **The Oracle's Assessment**

**N14 revealed that the future of AI would be determined more by corporate politics and employee loyalty than by careful safety considerations.**

The crisis lasted five days. The safety concerns that reportedly motivated the firing remain unresolved years later. What mattered was power, not principle.

**Critical Insight**: When 700+ employees can override board governance through threat of resignation, the board has no real power. OpenAI's subsequent evolution reflects this reality.
