# Node N787: Harvard gut discovery could change how we treat obesity and diabetes

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N787
- **Description**: Scientists found that certain molecules made by gut bacteria travel to the liver and help control how the body uses energy. These molecules change depending on diet, genetics, and shifts in the microbiome. Some even improved insulin response in liver cells when tested in the lab. The findings could open the door to new ways of preventing or managing obesity and diabetes.
