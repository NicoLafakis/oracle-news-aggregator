# Node N768: New discovery offers real hope for rare genetic disease

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N768
- **Description**: Scientists discovered that certain gene changes allow cells to function even when frataxin, the protein lost in Friedreich’s ataxia, is missing. Experiments in worms, human cells, and mice revealed that lowering a gene called FDX2 helps restore vital energy processes. The work points to a new, more targeted treatment strategy.
