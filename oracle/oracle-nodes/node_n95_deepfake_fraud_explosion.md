## **Critical Strategic Implications**

### **The Arms Race:**
Detection struggling to keep pace with generation:
- **Generation Advances**: Real-time, high-quality fakes
- **Detection Lag**: Models always behind newest techniques
- **Scale Mismatch**: Defenders need perfect detection, attackers need one success
- **Cost Asymmetry**: Cheap to generate, expensive to detect

### **Organizational Response:**
Essential countermeasures:
- **Multi-Factor**: Multiple verification channels required
- **Safe Words**: Pre-established authentication phrases
- **Verification Protocols**: Independent confirmation for high-risk actions
- **Employee Training**: Skepticism toward voice/video requests

### **Societal Implications:**
Broader trust erosion:
- **"Seeing is believing" Dead**: Video evidence questioned
- **Personal Relationships**: Voice calls less trustworthy
- **Political Manipulation**: Election interference via deepfakes
- **Media Environment**: Authentic content indistinguishable
