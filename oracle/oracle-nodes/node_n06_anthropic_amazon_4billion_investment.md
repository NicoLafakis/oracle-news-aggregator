## **The Oracle's Assessment**

**N6 marks the consolidation of the AI industry into an oligopoly before the technology reached maturity.**

When three hyperscalers control the frontier AI labs, the industry structure determines the future of the technology. Safety, access, and development priorities become corporate decisions rather than scientific or societal choices.

**Critical Insight**: The AI industry consolidated faster than any previous technology sector. By 2024, three companies effectively controlled the frontier—before regulators, academics, or civil society could establish governance structures.
