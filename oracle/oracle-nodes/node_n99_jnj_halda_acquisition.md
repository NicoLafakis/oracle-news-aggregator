- **New Targets**: Accesses previously impossible targets
- **Oral Delivery**: Some degraders can be pills
- **Selectivity**: Precise targeting of disease proteins

### **Big Pharma M&A Strategy:**
J&J exemplifies industry approach:
- **External Innovation**: Buy rather than build
- **Platform Plays**: Technology platforms over single drugs
- **Strategic Timing**: Acquire before late-stage value creation
- **Integration Risk**: Maintaining innovation post-acquisition

### **Biotech Ecosystem Impact:**
Deal signals market health:
- **Exit Path**: IPO market challenging, M&A viable
- **Valuation Benchmark**: $3B sets expectations
- **Investor Returns**: Early investors gain liquidity
- **Innovation Cycle**: Resources flow to next generation
