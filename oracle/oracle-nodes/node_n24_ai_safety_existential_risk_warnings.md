# Node N24: AI Safety Researchers Warn of Existential Risk

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N24
- **Description**: Throughout 2023-2025, prominent AI researchers including Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Stuart Russell warned about existential risks from advanced AI. These warnings intensified as capabilities accelerated, with researchers calling for mandatory safety testing and international coordination.
- **Verification_Status**: **Verified** ✅
- **Date**: 2023-2025 (ongoing)
- **Scope**: AI safety and existential risk discourse

---

## **Verified Context from Research**

### **Key Warnings:**
- **Geoffrey Hinton**: Left Google to speak freely about AI risks (May 2023)
- **Statement on AI Risk**: Signed by hundreds warning of extinction risk
- **Yoshua Bengio**: Called for international AI governance
- **Stuart Russell**: Advocated for provably safe AI development
- **Research Organizations**: MIRI, ARC, Anthropic prioritizing alignment

### **Specific Concerns:**
- Loss of human control over advanced systems
- Deceptive alignment (AI appearing safe while not)
- Rapid capability acceleration outpacing safety
- Concentration of power in few hands
- Autonomous weapons and military applications

### **Proposed Responses:**
- Mandatory safety testing before deployment
- International coordination agreements
- Compute governance and monitoring
- Research publication restrictions
- Kill switch and containment protocols

## **The Oracle's Assessment**

**N24 represents the scientific community's unprecedented warning that human survival may be at stake—and being largely ignored.**

The gap between expert concern and public/political response is striking. Those who understand AI best are most worried, while those making decisions often dismiss their concerns.
