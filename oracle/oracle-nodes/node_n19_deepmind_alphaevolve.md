## **The Oracle's Assessment**

**N19 represents AI becoming capable of the creative work that defines scientific progress—discovering new algorithms, not just implementing known ones.**

AlphaEvolve is significant because it demonstrates AI capability in a domain previously considered uniquely human: mathematical creativity. When AI breaks 56-year-old records in algorithm design, the question of what remains uniquely human becomes more urgent.

**Critical Insight**: The recursive potential is what matters most. AlphaEvolve improves AI training. Faster training creates better models. Better models create better AlphaEvolve. This feedback loop is exactly what AI safety researchers warn about.
