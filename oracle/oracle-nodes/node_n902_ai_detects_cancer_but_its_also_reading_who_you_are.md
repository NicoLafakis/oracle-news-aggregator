# Node N902: AI detects cancer but it’s also reading who you are

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N902
- **Description**: AI tools designed to diagnose cancer from tissue samples are quietly learning more than just disease patterns. New research shows these systems can infer patient demographics from pathology slides, leading to biased results for certain groups. The bias stems from how the models are trained and the data they see, not just from missing samples. Researchers also demonstrated a way to significantly...
