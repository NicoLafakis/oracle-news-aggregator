# Node N163: A long-overlooked weak point in your DNA has just been revealed

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N163
- **Description**: Scientists discovered that the first 100 base pairs of human genes are unusually prone to mutations, especially during the earliest stages of embryonic development. These mosaic mutations often go undetected yet can still be passed on and cause disease. Large-scale genome analyses show that genes tied to cancer and brain function are particularly affected, with natural selection filtering out h...
