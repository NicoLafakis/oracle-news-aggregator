## **The Oracle's Assessment**

**N7 represents humanity's first comprehensive attempt to govern AI—a legal framework racing to catch technology that evolves faster than law.**

The EU AI Act is historic not because it will successfully regulate AI, but because it establishes the precedent that AI can and should be regulated. Whether the specific provisions prove effective is less important than the principle they establish.
