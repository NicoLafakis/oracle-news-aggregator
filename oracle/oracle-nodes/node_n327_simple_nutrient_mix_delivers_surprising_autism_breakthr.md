# Node N327: Simple nutrient mix delivers surprising autism breakthrough in mice

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N327
- **Description**: A low-dose mix of zinc, serine, and branched-chain amino acids boosted neural function and social behavior in autism mouse models. The combination restored more typical synaptic protein patterns and reduced excessive amygdala activity. Individual supplements had no effect, showing that the nutrients must work together. The findings point toward a promising multi-nutrient strategy for influencin...
