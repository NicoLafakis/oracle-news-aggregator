# Node N1748: The deep ocean has a missing link and scientists finally found it

## **Node Details**
- **Node_ID**: N1748
- **Description**: Scientists have uncovered why big predators like sharks spend so much time in the ocean’s twilight zone. The answer lies with mid-sized fish such as the bigscale pomfret, which live deep during the day and rise at night to feed, linking deep and surface food webs. Using satellite tags, researchers tracked these hard-to-study fish for the first time. Their movements shift with water clarity, pot...
